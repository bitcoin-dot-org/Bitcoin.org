        <h1>15 May 2013 Upgrade Deadline</h1>
        <h2>What is happening</h2>
<p>
If you are using Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind version 0.7.2 or earlier, you must take action
before 15 May, 2013. If you do nothing, you are likely to be left behind and
will be out of sync with the rest of the Bitcoin network.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that you
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.1/">upgrade to version 0.8.1</a>
before the 15th of May to avoid any issues.  If you are a solo miner or mining pool operator,
please see the the notes at the end of this page for how to upgrade safely.
</p>
        <h2>If you cannot upgrade to version 0.8.1</h2>
<p>
If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, you can still avoid the problem.
Create a file called DB_CONFIG in the bitcoin data directory, containing
these two lines:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
set_lg_dir database
set_lk_max_locks 120000
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory">Look here</a> if you need help
finding the bitcoin data directory.
</p>
        <h2>Miners/mining pool operators</h2>
<p>
If you are creating new blocks (you are a solo miner or mining pool operator), then
you should be aware that upgrading from 0.7 to 0.8 requires a lengthy
re-indexing operation; you <b>must</b> wait for the reindex to complete before
serving work to miners.
</p>
<p>
And if you are creating blocks and cannot upgrade to version 0.8.1 for some
reason, you should <b>not</b> set_lk_max_locks in a DB_CONFIG file until
May 15th; if you increase locks before then you run the risk of creating
or building on blocks incompatible with the rest of the network.
</p>
        <h2>Why this is necessary</h2>
<p>
A bug caused a <a href="chainfork.html">temporary block chain fork on 11 March, 2013</a>.
After investigating
that bug, we determined that the bug can happen even if the entire network was
still running old versions of Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind. Therefore, the only option is to
require everybody to either upgrade or workaround the bug.
