## Adding Exchanges

Exchanges seeking to be added to Bitcoin.org should add themselves to the
respective area(s) they serve in `exchanges.html` in the `_templates` directory,
via [pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/new/master).

Shortly after the pull request is made, a Travis CI job will be added to [our
queue](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org). This will build the
site and run some basic checks. If the job fails, you will be emailed a link to
the build log and the pull request will indicate a failed job. Please read the
build report and try to correct the problem.

If you're not comfortable with GitHub pull requests, please open a
[new issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/new) requesting
to be added.

### Review Criteria

Exchanges are reviewed before potentially being added to the site, focusing on
the following areas:

+ Site functionality
+ Operational processes
+ Rates and fees
+ Order book
+ Policies, terms and conditions
+ Press and community feedback
+ Leadership

Once added, exchanges are also re-reviewed at regular intervals in order to
maintain quality assurance in-line with the above, and may be removed should
severe and/or unresolved issues be encountered.

### Review Fee

In an effort to help provide funding towards the operation of Bitcoin.org, and
to remain ad-free and without reliance on corporate sponsorships, an annual
non-refundable review fee of $2500 USD, payable in bitcoin, is requested of
exchanges seeking to be added to the site. Payment of this fee does not
guarantee inclusion, nor does it prevent removal should problems arise
post-inclusion.

Exchanges should email [exchanges@bitcoin.org](mailto:exchanges@bitcoin.org) in
order to make payment arrangements.

### Fee Waiver

Exchanges may request review fees to be waived if an independent third party
review has been procured in the past 90 days that satisfactorily addresses the
Review Criteria mentioned above.

### Questions

Please contact the [Exchange team](mailto:exchanges@bitcoin.org) if you have
questions or require assistance when adding an exchange.
