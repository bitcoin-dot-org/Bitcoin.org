        <h1>Potentially Critical Security Vulnerability</h1>
	<p>
A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in the Windows
version of Bitcoin-Qt. If you are running Bitcoin-Qt versions 0.5
through 0.6 on Windows you should shut it down and upgrade to either
version 0.5.3.1 or 0.6rc4 NOW.
</p><p>
The command-line bitcoin daemon (bitcoind), Mac and Linux versions of
Bitcoin-Qt, and versions prior to 0.5 are not affected.
</p><p>
Due to the nature of the vulnerability, we believe it would be very
difficult for an attacker to do anything more than crash the
Bitcoin-Qt process. However, because there is a possibility of such a
crash causing remote code execution we consider this a critical issue.
