<h2><img src="/img/ico_network.svg" alt="Network" />Be the network</h2>
<p>You can join the Bitcoin network by keeping the <a href="/en/download">original software</a> running on your computer. You can also do some Bitcoin mining to make the network more secure by helping to process transactions.</p>
