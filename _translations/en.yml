    pagetitle: "About Bitcoin"
    history: "A bit of history"
    historytxt1: "Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities."
    historytxt2: "In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project, saying he had moved on to other things. The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his identity and simply left his invention to the world. The origin and the motivation behind Bitcoin are still today a great source of mystery."
    historytxt3: "Since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown with many developers working on the project. During June and July 2011, Bitcoin suddenly gained media attention leading to a massive buy rally. The resulting bubble slowly deflated through the latter part of 2011, and since then the value of Bitcoin has slowly climbed once again back to its 2011 heights."
    historytxt4: "On September 27th 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation was created in an effort to standardize, protect, and promote Bitcoin. Today, the Bitcoin economy is developing quickly with new users joining every day."

    title: "Bitcoin for Businesses - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Businesses"
    summary: "Bitcoin is a very secure and inexpensive way to handle payments."
    lowfee: "The lowest fees out there"
    lowfeetext: "Bitcoin's high cryptographic security allows it to process transactions in a very efficient and inexpensive way. You can make and receive payments using the Bitcoin network with zero fees in most cases. You can pay a very small voluntary fee if you want to increase a transaction's priority."
    fraud: "Protection against payment and chargeback fraud"
    fraudtext: "Any business that accepts credit card or PayPal payments knows the problem of payments that are later reversed because the sender's account was hacked or they fraudulently claimed non-delivery. The only way businesses can defend themselves against this kind of fraud is with complex risk analysis and increased prices to cover the losses. Bitcoin payments are irreversible and wallets can be kept highly secure, meaning that the cost of theft is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of the merchants."
    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: "Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. In fact, bitcoins never have any real physical location, so it is possible to transfer as many of them anywhere with no limits, delays, or excessive fees. There are no intermediate banks to make you wait three business days."
    pci: "No PCI compliance required"
    pcitext: "Accepting credit cards online typically requires extensive security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. While it is a good thing to protect credit cards, Bitcoin security is built in such a way that makes this approach obsolete. Your payments are secured by the network, not at your expense."
    instant: "Instant transactions for points-of-sale"
    instanttext: "A Bitcoin transaction is usually deployed within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transactions, it is recommended that you ask for a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system."
    visibility: "Get some free visibility"
    visibilitytext: "Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their coins. Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has always shown to be a clever practice for online businesses."
    multisig: "Multi-signature"
    multisigtext: "Bitcoin also includes a feature, not yet well known, which allows coins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people sign the transaction (so-called \"n of m\" transactions). This is the equivalent of the good old multi-signature cheque system that you might still use with banks today."
    transparency: "Accounting transparency"
    transparencytext: "Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity and to adopt good transparency practices. Using Bitcoin offers the highest level of transparency since your balance and your transactions are public for your members so long as you keep them aware of your Bitcoin addresses."
  bitcoin-for-developers:
    title: "Bitcoin for Developers - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Developers"
    summary: "Bitcoin can be used to build amazing things or just answer common needs."
    simple: "The simplest of all payment systems"
    simpletext: "Unless payment needs to be associated with automatic invoices, accepting money is as simple as adding a Bitcoin address to a website as a bitcoin: link or QR code. This very simple setup is within reach of any user and can fulfill the needs of a good range of clients. It's especially suitable for donations."
    api: "Many third party APIs"
    apitext: "There are many third party payment processing services that provide APIs; you don't need to store bitcoins on your server and handle the security that this implies. At the same time, most of these APIs allow you to exchange your bitcoins into your local currency at competitive costs."
    own: "You can be your own financial system"
    owntext: "If you don't use any third party APIs, you can integrate a Bitcoin server directly in your applications, allowing you to become your own bank and payment processor. With all the responsibilities that this implies, you can build amazing systems that process Bitcoin transactions with almost no fees."
    invoice: "Bitcoin addresses to track invoices"
    invoicetext: "Bitcoin can create as many Bitcoin addresses as you want. So if you were to build a payment system associated with an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Bitcoin address for each payment. You can also use the same addresses once the payment is done."
    security: "Most of the security is on client side"
    securitytext: "Most parts of the security are handled by the protocol on the client and Bitcoin network side. Authenticity is verified through private keys, and double-spends are prevented through the Bitcoin network. That means no PCI compliance nor fraud detection. We love things that just work, don't we?"
    instant: "Instant transactions and confirmations"
    instanttext: "A Bitcoin transaction is usually received within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transactions, it is recommended that you ask for a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system."
    micro: "Cheap micro payments"
    microtext: "Bitcoin offers the lowest payment processing fees for any type of transaction, including micro-payments. This means that it can also be used to design and implement new creative online services that could not exist before only because of financial limitations."
  bitcoin-for-enthusiasts:
    title: "Bitcoin for Enthusiasts - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Enthusiasts"
    summary: "Bitcoin is changing the world of finance, by giving you control over your money."
    consensus: "Bitcoin is a worldwide consensus"
    consensustext: "Because of its decentralized, open-source nature, Bitcoin is the first payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority. Even Bitcoin developers have no power to force updates in the protocol if enough users, developers, or miners disagree. <i>You</i> have exclusive control over your wallet."
    network: "Digital money made for the Internet"
    networktext: "Bitcoin was born from the Internet, bringing the freedom of physical money to the virtual world while making payments easier and more secure in both worlds. Bitcoin can offer an alternative to previous cumbersome and costly systems, and it can increase online business access to developing countries."
    freedom: "Protecting individual rights and freedom"
    freedomtext: "Bitcoin allows people to securely store and exchange value on a network that cannot be seized, manipulated, or stopped by any organization or individual. It gives many powerful tools to the people so that it is easier to protect individual rights against various levels of corruption."
    global: "The first neutral global currency"
    globaltext: "Not often in our history has money been disconnected from any political influence or national economy. Could Bitcoin be the first global currency to cross all barriers between nations, politics, and cultures for the benefit of the common good? It certainly looks like it might happen. One for all and all for one!"
    transparency: "Promoting transparency"
    transparencytext: "All Bitcoin transactions are public, but the owners or recipients of these transactions are not. Organizations can choose to reveal their ownership of some Bitcoin addresses to their members, allowing them to implement high levels of transparency."
    secure: "Making money more secure"
    securetext: "Thanks to a clever use of strict cryptographic rules, Bitcoin provides an amazing list of security features. Not only are bitcoins impossible to counterfeit or spoof, but the protocol is also built to be very resistant against an impressive list of attacks, including distributed denial of service."
    trust: "Solving issues with trust in banks"
    trusttext: "Bitcoin offers solutions to many of the trust problems that plague banks thanks to selective accounting transparency, signature proofs, and irreversible transactions. It also increases the risks for crooked bankers: no bitcoins can be created to save them from their own mistakes at the expense of the people."
  bitcoin-for-individuals:
    title: "Bitcoin for Individuals - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Individuals"
    summary: "Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost."
    mobile: "Mobile payments made easy"
    mobiletext: "Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. And all you need to do to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology)."
    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: "Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, level outrageous fees, or freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country."
    simple: "Works everywhere, anytime"
    simpletext: "Just like with email, you don't need to force your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!"
    secure: "Secure transactions"
    securetext: "Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can make a payment on your behalf or charge you money without having a copy of your wallet. So as long as you take the required steps to <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">protect your wallet</a>, Bitcoin provides a nice level of protection against many types of fraud."
    lowfee: "Almost free to use"
    lowfeetext: "Bitcoin allows you to send and receive payments for free. Except for special cases like very tiny micro-payments, there is no enforced fee. You can, however, choose to pay a small voluntary fee to increase your transaction priority and to remunerate the people who operate the Bitcoin network."
    anonymous: "Pseudo-anonymous online payments"
    anonymoustext: "Anonymous payments are a part of our everyday lives - most real life purchases are done without the requirement to provide proper identification. Bitcoin now introduces the same freedom to the online world. It allows you to buy services or make donations without the hassle of being passed under x-ray. However, you should note that <a href=\"#you-need-to-know#\"><b>full anonymity requires special efforts</b></a>."

    volunteer: "Contact Potential Interviewees"
    volunteerdiscl: "Bitcoin has no official organization, individuals with authority, nor spokespeople. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"disclaimershow(event);\">Read more</a>"
    volunteerdiscltext: "The Bitcoin project is open-source and, likewise, no one can speak with authority for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community contains individuals who hold a wide spectrum of business experience or involvement, political ideas, personal opinions, technical competency, and style. This list of potential interviewees has been curated by Bitcoin community members with the intent to include individuals possessing a wide spectrum of experience, ideas, and geography. The individuals listed have been involved in the Bitcoin community for a significant period making tangible contributions, have demonstrated competence and professionalism when discussing Bitcoin, are flexible and willing to assist members of the press in both objective and persuasive ways, and are generally respected by other members of the Bitcoin community. However, an individual's appearance here should not be misconstrued as a general endorsement, either by the Bitcoin community or any particular individuals with, regards to potential interviewees and any businesses they may operate, nor any political or personal ideas they may expound, including prognostications about Bitcoin or the price or any other topic."
    faq: "Facts, FAQs and Myths"
    faqwhat: "What is Bitcoin?"
    faqwhattxt: "Bitcoin is an Internet protocol and open-source software platform that enables a new, completely digital and decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC)."
    faqacquire: "How does one acquire bitcoins?"
    faqacquiretxt1: "Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services."
    faqacquiretxt2: "Buy bitcoins at one of the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins\">Bitcoin Exchanges</a>."
    faqacquiretxt3: "Trade traditional currency for bitcoins using one of several services."
    faqacquiretxt4: "Trade traditional currency for bitcoins face to face using a <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Directories\">local directory</a>."
    faqacquiretxt5: "Earn bitcoins through competitive <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining\">mining</a>."
    faqhow: "How does Bitcoin work?"
    faqhowtxt: "Bitcoin is a <a href=\"http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html\">triple entry bookkeeping system</a> where a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction is validated and distributed in real-time through the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. The whole network is secured and regulated through cryptography. Anyone can process transactions using computer processing power, often with specialized hardware, and potentially earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called \"bitcoin mining\"."
    faqmining: "How does Bitcoin mining work?"
    faqminingtxt1: "Bitcoin miners perform a function that is analogous to gold mining, but very different. While gold miners deal with rocks, Bitcoin miners deal with data."
    faqminingtxt2: "Bitcoin mining is the mechanism that keeps everyone in the system synchronized together. To mine, computers that take part listen for transactions (ledger transfer announcements) broadcast through the peer-to-peer network. The miners process and confirm these transactions by including them in a block and adding the block to the block chain."
    faqminingtxt3: "Bitcoin miners perform this labor because miners that solve a block earn (1) any transaction fees paid by customers for faster transaction processing and (2) newly created coins, issued into existence according to a fixed formula."
    faqminingtxt4: "Bitcoin mining is a very competitive market. Bitcoin miners are neither able to increase their own block reward beyond the rules in the protocol nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network. Because anyone can become a Bitcoin miner and the Bitcoin network is the largest distributed computer network in the world, it is extremely improbable that a malicious Bitcoin miner could compromise the block chain. Thus, Bitcoin mining is used to protect the neutrality and the consensus of the network, even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted."
    faqdifficult: "How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?"
    faqdifficulttxt: "Bitcoin payments are easier to make than any existing banking or credit card process.  Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address. This can be done by scanning a QR code, touching two phones together with NFC technology, or copying and pasting, entering the amount, and pressing send."
    faqadvantage: "What are the advantages of Bitcoin?"
    faqadvantagetxt1: "<em><b>Unrestrained payments</b></em> - It is possible to send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No imposed limits."
    faqadvantagetxt2: "<em><b>Low or zero fees</b></em> - Bitcoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins to fiat currencies with daily direct deposits to bank accounts, and to provide these services for much lower fees and less risk than with PayPal or credit card networks."
    faqadvantagetxt3: "<em><b>Fewer fees and risks for merchants</b></em> - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks and there is no need for PCI compliance. Consequently, merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs."
    faqadvantagetxt4: "<em><b>More protection for consumers</b></em> - Bitcoin payments are made without needing the personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Users are in full control of their transactions, therefore it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges - this can happen with ACH debits, debit cards, PayPal, and credit cards."
    faqadvantagetxt5: "<em><b>Transparency</b></em> - <a href=\"http://blockchain.info\">All information</a> concerning the Bitcoin money supply is readily available on the block chain for anybody to see, verify, measure, and use in real-time."
    faqadvantagetxt6: "<em><b>Distributed</b></em> - The Bitcoin ledger, commonly called the block chain, is distributed throughout the world and stored by Bitcoin miners. This adds a level of resiliency and redundancy that is unmatched in the payments space and a payment processing network. For example, the Federal Reserve does all their payment processing at 100 Orchard Street, East Rutherford, New Jersey and it has back-up systems that can be brought online within 60-90 minutes at the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Dallas. If those three centers were compromised or destroyed then the entire monetary system of the Federal Reserve would be greatly impaired and probably completely non-functional."
    faqdisadvantage: "What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?"
    faqdisadvantagetxt1: "<em><b>Not widely accepted</b></em> - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Every day more businesses accept bitcoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to gain improved usefulness through networking effects."
    faqdisadvantagetxt2: "<em><b>Volatile</b></em> - The <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap\">total value</a> of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will persist as the market scrambles to determine a bitcoin’s price and as this new currency matures.  Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out."
    faqdisadvantagetxt3: "<em><b>For geeks</b></em> - Many of the user tools are still not ready for everyone and users still need to protect their money by themselves, or trust young online wallet services that still don’t offer any insurance against theft or other bad events. New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses. From now, Bitcoin is a bright new invention that starts to meet the real world."
    faqsecure: "Is Bitcoin secure?"
    faqsecuretxt: "The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record. Bitcoin's vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost, stolen, or compromised. Consequently, users need to employ <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">security practices</a> to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance. As more people have adopted Bitcoin, more service providers have appeared to make it easier, safer, and more convenient to use and safely secure bitcoins. Bitcoins are not covered by insurance schemes or depositor insurance like the FDIC, but users' wallets could be with a service provider that offers that provision."
    faqlegal: "Is Bitcoin legal?"
    faqlegaltxt1: "To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in any jurisdiction."
    faqlegaltxt2: "Additionally, regulators from various jurisdictions have taken steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology into businesses and other activities. For example, the United States' FinCEN has issued non-binding and non-determinative guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies."
    faqlegalresource: "Useful resources:"
    faqtax: "What about Bitcoin and taxes?"
    faqtaxtxt: "Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin. Because all transactions are public record and stored permanently, it is a bad idea to attempt to use Bitcoin to evade taxes."
    faqillegal: "Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?"
    faqillegaltxt1: "Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. This means transactions cannot be stopped. However, it is not anonymous, and the use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records."
    faqillegaltxt2: "The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’"
    faqillegaltxt3: "Bitcoin prevents many criminals from being able to engage in illegal behavior. Because of the way Bitcoin works, customers do not need to reveal personal information to merchants. This decreases the amount of data available to illegal actors and acts as significant protection against identity theft, credit card fraud, and several other attack vectors. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible which prevents chargebacks or frauds, and transaction traceability means it is impossible to counterfeit bitcoins."
    faqillegaltxt4: "Additionally, law enforcement authorities have already begun using sophisticated techniques to analyze Bitcoin transactions in their criminal investigations. So it may be that the Bitcoin software is not very attractive for criminal enterprises."
    faqbubble: "Is Bitcoin a bubble?"
    faqbubbletxt1: "A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble.  An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble."
    faqbubbletxt2: "Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for Bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, excessive press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and just old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed."
    faqjune: "Why did Bitcoin’s price crash in June 2011?"
    faqjunetxt: "Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants was the cause for Bitcoin's price crash in June 2011. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, the largest exchange, MtGox, having a security incident, a large difference between value and price from the large amount of press coverage which stimulated speculative demand not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, and just old fashioned irrational exuberance and greed."
    faqprice: "What determines Bitcoin’s price?"
    faqpricetxt: "The price of bitcoins is determined by supply and demand. The supply is fixed at 21 million because of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. There are two main types of demand: speculative and transactional. As more people use bitcoins for transactions, demand will increase and so will the price of bitcoins. Likewise, as more people speculate on the future of Bitcoin by saving or hoarding bitcoins, this increases the demand for bitcoins and the price. The result is an increase of network effects and increased adoption."
    faqponzi: "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?"
    faqponzitxt1: "A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation."
    faqponzitxt2: "Bitcoin is an open-source software project with no central authority and consequently no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollars, Euros, Yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate freely floats. This can lead to volatility where owners of bitcoins can make or lose value."
    faqponzitxt3: "Bitcoin is an innovative currency and payment system and not a Ponzi scheme. However, since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible it can be attractive for a Ponzi scam operator, and there have been several notable Ponzi scams which have failed and did use Bitcoin."
    faqsatoshi: "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin?"
    faqsatoshitxt: "The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his real identity and simply left his invention to the world. Satoshi created the first Bitcoin implementation and remained active in the development for a few years before choosing to leave the project. Meanwhile, a strong community of developers, miners, users, and supporters have spontaneously emerged to continue the project."
    faqworthless: "Can bitcoins become worthless?"
    faqworthlesstxt1: "Yes. There are thousands of currencies in the fiat currency graveyard as a result of hyperinflation, such as the German Mark, United States gold and silver certificates, Argentine Peso, and, more recently, the Zimbabwe Dollar. Unlike a physical currency, such as gold, Bitcoin is a completely virtual currency. While Bitcoin was designed to be censorship-resistant, to enable it to continue existing if there were to be some type of technological problem of significant severity, it is still possible, although more unlikely every day, that Bitcoin could stop working as intended. Then all bitcoins could become worthless."
    faqworthlesstxt2: "Being an open-source project allows anyone to contribute software code and those with value stored in bitcoins have a strong financial incentive in making sure Bitcoin continues to exist. For example, there has been only one major security incident in the protocol and it was fixed in August 2010. While there have been no major incidents since that does not preclude the possibility that there could be others. There was an unanticipated \"hard fork\" on 12 March 2013 which was quickly resolved with minimal impact on Bitcoin users. But the longer Bitcoin exists without a major security incident, or other unanticipated software bugs, then the more likely market participants will gain greater confidence in Bitcoin."
    faqworthlesstxt3: "As a payment tool bitcoins are like gold because bitcoins are no-one’s liability, and Bitcoin transactions are not subject to the same counterparty risk like traditional banks engaged in fractional reserve banking. Thus, using Bitcoin can help protect merchants and users from bank failures and Cyprus-style problems. Bitcoin empowers its users to have exclusive control of their funds."
    faqvirtual: "Is Bitcoin virtual and immaterial?"
    faqvirtualtxt1: "Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks that people are using every day. They are both a balance stored in a network."
    faqvirtualtxt2: "While Bitcoin is better suited for use on the Internet than other payment systems, Bitcoin can also be used to pay in physical stores, just like real money."
    faqvirtualtxt3: "Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds. Bitcoin balances are stored in an extremely large, decentralized distributed computer network and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other terms, bitcoins cannot vanish or be seized by any means. But they can be stolen or lost due to users' mistakes."
    faqtrust: "Why do people trust Bitcoin?"
    faqtrusttxt1: "Bitcoin is open-source software, which means that everyone has access to all of the source code all of the time. The rules of the system are embedded into the source code and the participants all impose those rules on each other simultaneously. To change the system would require everyone to switch to a new version of the software that used different rules, and because Bitcoin users are spread across the world, it is outside the power of any single jurisdictional authority to mandate such a change."
    faqtrusttxt2: "Cryptography is well established and a fundamental technology used in online banking. But unlike fiat currency with central banks and online banking with heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic ciphers, Bitcoin has been able to construct a currency and payment network that removes the need to trust a central authority."
    faqtrusttxt3: "Consequently, many people trust Bitcoin because it requires absolutely no trust at all."
    faqanonymous: "Bitcoin is an anonymous currency?"
    faqanonymoustxt1: "Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. It is not anonymous but it is pseudo-anonymous. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records for each transaction. All transactions can be traced since their origin and IP addresses are permanently logged by organizations listening on the network. All of this information can easily be accessed by competitors, law enforcement, or anyone else."
    faqanonymoustxt2: "However, there are a few technically difficult and costly methods that can enable users to interact with Bitcoin in very private ways. The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’"
    faqanonymoustxt3: "Transactions are difficult to conceal from best practices in network data analysis, data mining, and forensic accounting techniques. In most transactions, personal information must be revealed to receive the goods or services from an order. This makes keeping full anonymity with Bitcoin transactions very difficult or impossible."

You can disclose one of your Bitcoin addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa, you can pay your friends if they give you their addresses. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works. So all that is left to do at this point is to get some bitcoins and to <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">keep them safe</a>.

    title: "Securing your wallet - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Securing your wallet"
    summary: "Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Bitcoin allows the transfer of value worldwide easier than ever. Such great features also come with great security concerns. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. <b>Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money</b>. Here are some things you should consider."
    online: "Be careful with online wallets"
    onlinetxt: "Online wallets look like online banks. You are trusting someone to store and protect your bitcoins while you have to remember your password. However, you should always choose such services carefully. As of today, no online wallet provides enough insurance and security to be used to store value like a bank. Using security features like two-factor authentication can also increase the security of your acccounts."
    backup: "Backup your wallet"
    backuptxt: "Bitcoin services and software allow you to backup your wallet. Stored in a safe place, a backup can protect you against computer failures and many human mistakes."
    backupwhole: "Backup your entire wallet"
    backupwholetxt: "Your wallet contains many private keys that receive the change of your transactions in order to protect your privacy. If you only have a backup of your visible private keys, you might not be able to recover a great part of your funds with your backup."
    backuponline: "Encrypt online backups"
    backuponlinetxt: "Any backup that is stored online is highly vulnerable to theft. Even a computer that is connected to the Internet is vulnerable to malicious software. As such, encrypting any backup that is exposed to the network is a good security practice."
    backupmany: "Use many secure locations"
    backupmanytxt: "Single points of failure are bad for security. If your backup is not dependent of a single location, it is less likely that any bad event will prevent you to recover your wallet. You might also want to consider using different medias like USB keys, papers and CDs."
    backupregular: "Make regular backups"
    backupregulartxt: "You need to backup your wallet on a regular basis to make sure that all recent Bitcoin change addresses and all new Bitcoin addresses you created are included in your backup. However, all applications will be soon using wallets that only need to be backed up once."
    encrypt: "Encrypt your wallet"
    encrypttxt: "Encrypting your wallet allows you to set a password for anyone trying to withdraw any funds. This helps protect against thieves, though it cannot protect against keylogging hardware or software."
    encryptforget: "Never forget your password"
    encryptforgettxt: "You should make sure you never forget the password or your funds will be permanently lost. Unlike your bank, there are no password recovery options with Bitcoin. In fact, you should be able to remember your password even after many years without using it. In doubt, you might want to keep a paper copy of your password in a safe place like a vault."
    encryptstrong: "Use a strong password"
    encryptstrongtxt: "Any password that contains only letters or recognizable words can be considered very weak and easy to break. A strong password must contain letters, numbers, punctuation marks and must be at least 16 characters long. Still, this should not prevent you to remember your password."
    offline: "Offline wallet for savings"
    offlinetxt: "An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings. It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network. When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities. It is however very important to test this type of setup before you start to use it with serious transactions. Using an offline wallets in conjunction with backups and encryption is also a good practice. Here is an overview of some approaches."
    offlinetx: "Offline transaction signing"
    offlinetxtxt1: "This approach involves having two computers sharing some parts of the same wallet. The first one must be disconnected from any network. It is the only one that holds the entire wallet and is able to sign transactions. The second computer is connected to the network and only have a watching wallet that can only create unsigned transactions. This way, you can securely issue new transactions with the following steps."
    offlinetxtxt2: "Create a new transaction on the online computer and save it on an USB key."
    offlinetxtxt3: "Sign the transaction with the offline computer."
    offlinetxtxt4: "Send the signed transaction with the online computer."
    offlinetxtxt5: "Because the computer that is connected to the network cannot sign transactions, it cannot be used to withdraw any funds if it is compromised. <a href=\"https://bitcoinarmory.com/using-offline-wallets-in-armory/\">Armory</a> can be used to do offline transaction signature."
    offlinetmp: "Temporary environment"
    offlinetmptxt: "This approach involves loading a wallet inside a temporary environment. For example, it is possible to boot on a Linux live CD, load a light SPV wallet software with its configuration from an USB key and issue a transaction. When a computer is booted from a trusted read-only environment that is only loaded in memory, malicious code is kept away and no trace of your wallet is left on the hard drive. You should however be very careful with the following points."
    offlinetmplose: "Losing funds"
    offlinetmplosetxt: "A temporary environment is the perfect place to lose funds forever. If your wallet is not correctly loaded from an external permanent storage like an USB key, any changes made in your wallet will be lost permanently. Including the new Bitcoin adresses that might have been created during the temporary session to receive the change of your last transactions."
    offlinetmpmiss: "Password mismatch"
    offlinetmpmisstxt: "Booting in a temporary environment might possibly assign a different layout to your keyboard which will later produce different characters then expected. When using encryption, this can cause password mismatches. You might want to type your password on the screen to prevent problems."
    offlinetmptrace: "Leaving no trace"
    offlinetmptracetxt: "As long as a storage media like a hard drive is connected to the computer, there is a small risk that some traces of your private keys can remain. You might want to disconnect any hard drive or disable all swap partitions before loading your wallet."
    offlinemulti: "Multi-signature to protect against theft"
    offlinemultitxt: "Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require the signature of more than one private key to be spent. It is however only usable for technical users but a greater availability for this feature can be expected in the future. Multi-signature can allow an organization to give access to its treasury to its members while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. It can also allow future online wallets to share a multi-signature address with their users, so that a thief would need to compromise both your computer and the online wallet servers in order to steal your funds."
    offlinemobile: "Small amounts on your mobile"
    offlinemobiletxt: "A Bitcoin wallet on your phone is like a wallet with cash. If you wouldn't keep a thousand dollar in your pocket, you might want to have the same consideration for your Bitcoin wallet. You can easily add more funds at any time on your mobile. This way, you can combine security with ease of use."
    offlinetestament: "Think about your testament"
    offlinetestamenttxt: "Your bitcoins can be lost forever if you don't have a backup plan for your peers and family. If the location of your wallets or your passwords are not known by anyone when you are gone, there is no hope that your funds will ever be recovered. Taking a bit of time on these matters can make a huge difference."

Bitcoin <a href=\"#[vocabulary.mining]\">mining</a> and the <a href=\"#[vocabulary.block-chain]\">block chain</a> are there to create a consensus on the network about which of the two transactions will win."
    hashrate: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.hash-rate]\">Hash Rate</a>"
    hashratetxt: "The hash rate is the <b>measuring unit of the processing power of the Bitcoin network</b>. The Bitcoin network must make intensive mathematical operations for security purposes. When the network reaches a hash rate of 10 TH/s, it means it can make 10 trillion calculations per second."
    mining: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.mining]\">Mining</a>"
    miningtxt: "Bitcoin mining is the process of <b>making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions</b> and increase security. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm, along with newly created bitcoins. Mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done. Not all Bitcoin users do Bitcoin mining, and it is not an easy way to make money."
    p2p: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.p2p]\">P2P</a>"
    p2ptxt: "Peer-to-peer refers to <b>systems that work like an organized collective</b> by allowing each individual to interact directly with the others. In the case of Bitcoin, the network is built in such a way that each user is broadcasting the transactions of other users. And, crucially, no bank is required as a third party."
    privatekey: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.private-key]\">Private Key</a>"
    privatekeytxt: "A private key is a <b>secret piece of data that proves your right to spend bitcoins from a specific Bitcoin address</b> through a cryptographic <a href=\"#[vocabulary.signature]\">signature</a>. Each <a href=\"#[vocabulary.address]\">Bitcoin address</a> has its own unique private key. Your private keys are stored in your computer if you use a software wallet;  they are stored on some remote servers if you use a web wallet. Private keys must never be revealed as they allow you to spend bitcoins for their respective Bitcoin addresses."
    signature: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.signature]\">Signature</a>"
    signaturetxt: "A <a href=\"#[vocabulary.cryptography]\">cryptographic</a> signature is <b>a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership</b>. In the case of Bitcoin, a <a href=\"#[vocabulary.address]\">Bitcoin address</a> and its <a href=\"#[vocabulary.private-key]\">private key</a> are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the Bitcoin address. However, there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins."
    wallet: "<a name=\"[vocabulary.wallet]\">Wallet</a>"
    wallettxt: "A Bitcoin wallet is loosely <b>the equivalent of a physical wallet on the Bitcoin network</b>. The wallet actually contains your <a href=\"#[vocabulary.private-key]\">private keys</a> which allow you to spend the bitcoins allocated to your <a href=\"#[vocabulary.address]\">Bitcoin addresses</a> in the <a href=\"#[vocabulary.block-chain]\">block chain</a>. Each Bitcoin wallet can show you the total balance of all Bitcoin addresses it contains and lets you pay a specific amount to a specific person, just like a real wallet. This is different to credit cards where you are charged by the merchant."
  you-need-to-know:
    title: "Some things you need to know - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Some things you need to know"
    summary: "If you are about to explore Bitcoin, there are a few things you should know. Bitcoin does not let you send emails or take pictures; it lets you exchange money and value. As such, Bitcoin must be treated with the same care as your regular wallet, or even more in some cases!"
    secure: "Securing your wallet"
    securetxt: "Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Bitcoin allows the transfer of value worldwide easier than ever. Such great features also come with great security concerns. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money. <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\"><b>Read more about securing your wallet</b></a>."
    volatile: "Bitcoin price is volatile"
    volatiletxt: "The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings in bitcoin is not recommended. Bitcoin should be considered as a high risk asset, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many service providers allow you to convert them instantly to your local currency."
    irreversible: "Bitcoin payments are irreversible"
    irreversibletxt: "Any transaction you issue with Bitcoin cannot be reversed, it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds. That means you should take care to do business with people or organizations you know and trust. But don't worry, Bitcoin can detect typos and usually won't let you send money to an invalid address."
    anonymous: "Bitcoin is not anonymous"
    anonymoustxt: "Some effort is required in order to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the owner cannot be associated with their Bitcoin address until personal information is revealed by the owner during an exchange. This is why it is recommended for Bitcoin owners to use many different Bitcoin addresses; in fact, you should create a new one each time you receive money. This is especially important for public uses such as websites. You might also want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> so that it cannot be logged."
    experimental: "Bitcoin is still experimental"
    experimentaltxt: "Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Although it becomes less experimental as usage grows, you should keep in mind that Bitcoin is a new invention that is exploring ideas that have never been attempted before. As such, its future cannot be predicted by anyone."
    tax: "Don't forget government taxes"
    taxtxt: "Bitcoin is not an official currency. That said, most jurisdictions still require you to pay income, sales, payroll, and capital gains taxes on anything that has value, including Bitcoin."
