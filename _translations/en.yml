    pagedesc: "Bitcoin.org is dedicated to help Bitcoin to develop in a sustainable way."
    own: "Who owns bitcoin.org?"
    owntxt: "Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Bitcoin's first two developers, <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> and <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Sirius\">Martti Malmi</a>.  When Nakamoto left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control over the Bitcoin project."
    owntxt2: "From 2011 to 2013, the site was primarily used for releasing new versions of the software now called Bitcoin Core. In 2013, the site was redesigned into its current form, adding numerous pages, listing additional Bitcoin software, and creating the translation system.  Developer documentation was added in 2014."
    owntxt3: "Today the site is an independent open source project with contributors from around the world. Final publication authority is held by the co-owners, but all regular activity is organized through the public <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org#working-with-github\">pull request process</a> and managed by the site co-maintainers."
    owntxt4: "Bitcoin.org is not Bitcoin's official website. Just like nobody owns the email technology, nobody owns the Bitcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Bitcoin."
    control: "Then... who controls Bitcoin?"
    controltxt: "Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. Developers are improving the software but they can't force a change in the rules of the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work decently with a complete consensus between all users. Therefore, all users and developers have strong incentives to adopt and protect this consensus."
    mission: "Mission"
    missiontxt1: "Inform users to protect them from common mistakes."
    missiontxt2: "Give an accurate description of Bitcoin properties, potential uses and limitations."
    missiontxt3: "Display transparent alerts and events regarding the Bitcoin network."
    missiontxt4: "Invite talented humans to help with Bitcoin development at many levels."
    missiontxt5: "Provide visibility to the large scale Bitcoin ecosystem."
    missiontxt6: "Improve Bitcoin worldwide accessibility with internationalization."

    title: "Bitcoin for Businesses - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Businesses"
    summary: "Bitcoin is a very secure and inexpensive way to handle payments."
    lowfee: "Choose your own fees"
    lowfeetext: >
      There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you
      control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have
      reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster <a
      href="#you-need-to-know##instant">confirmation</a> of your
      transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's
      possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to
      send 1 bitcoin.


    fraud: "Protection against fraud"
    fraudtext: "Any business that accepts credit cards or PayPal knows the problem of payments that are later reversed. Chargeback frauds result in limited market reach and increased prices, which in turn penalizes customers. Bitcoin payments are irreversible and secure, meaning that the cost of fraud is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of the merchants."
    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: >
      Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across
      the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business
      days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no
      special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.

    pci: "No PCI compliance required"
    pcitext: "Accepting credit cards online typically requires extensive security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. Bitcoin still requires you to <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">secure your wallet</a> and your payment requests. However, you do not carry the costs and responsibilities that come with processing sensitive information from your customers like credit card numbers."
    visibility: "Get some free visibility"
    visibilitytext: "Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their bitcoins. Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever practice for online businesses."
    multisig: "Multi-signature"
    multisigtext: "Bitcoin also includes a multi-signature feature which allows bitcoins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people authorize the transaction. This can be used by a board of directors to prevent any member to make expenditures without enough consent from other members, as well as to track which members allowed each payment."
    transparency: "Accounting transparency"
    transparencytext: "Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. Using Bitcoin allows you to offer the highest level of transparency since you can provide information your members can use to verify your balances and transactions. Non-profit organizations can also allow the public to see how much they receive in donations."
  bitcoin-for-developers:
    title: "Bitcoin for Developers - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Developers"
    summary: "Bitcoin can be used to build amazing things or just answer common needs."
    simple: "The simplest of all payment systems"
    simpletext: "Unless payment needs to be associated with automatic invoices, accepting money is as simple as sending a bitcoin: link or displaying a QR code. This simple setup is within reach of any user and can fulfill the needs of a good range of clients. When done publicly, it is especially suitable for transparent donations and tips."
    api: "Many third party APIs"
    apitext: "There are many third party payment processing services that provide APIs; you don't need to store bitcoins on your server and handle the security that this implies. Additionally, most of these APIs allow you to process invoices and exchange your bitcoins into your local currency at competitive costs."
    own: "You can be your own financial system"
    owntext: >
      If you don't use any third party APIs, you can integrate a Bitcoin
      node directly into your applications, allowing you to become your
      own bank and payment processor. With all the responsibilities that
      this implies, you can build amazing systems that process Bitcoin
      transactions however you would like.

    invoice: "Bitcoin addresses to track invoices"
    invoicetext: "Bitcoin creates a unique address for each transaction. So if you were to build a payment system associated with an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Bitcoin address for each payment. You should never use the same address for more than one transaction."
    security: "Most of the security is on client side"
    securitytext: >
      Most security is handled by the protocol, eliminating the need for
      PCI compliance. Fraud prevention can be simplified down to
      monitoring a single variable: the <a
      href="#you-need-to-know##instant">confirmation score</a>. Beyond
      that, keeping
      your bitcoins secure is mainly a matter of <a
      href="#secure-your-wallet#">securing your wallet</a> and using
      HTTPS or other secure protocols to send payment requests to customers.

    micro: "New payment possibilities"
    microtext: >
      Bitcoin allows you to design new and creative online services
      that couldn't exist before because of financial limitations. This
      includes tipping systems, automated payment solutions,
      distributed crowd-funding services, time locked payment
      management, public asset tracking, low-trust escrow services,
      micro-payment channels, and more.

  bitcoin-for-individuals:
    title: "Bitcoin for Individuals - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Individuals"
    summary: "Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost."
    mobile: "Mobile payments made easy"
    mobiletext: "Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology)."
    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: >
      Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across
      the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business
      days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no
      special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.

    simple: "Works everywhere, anytime"
    simpletext: "Just like with email, you don't need to ask your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!"
    secure: "Security and control over your money"
    securetext: "Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">protect your wallet</a>, Bitcoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud."
    lowfee: "Choose your own fees"
    lowfeetext: >
      There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you
      control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have
      reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster <a

      transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's
      possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to
      send 1 bitcoin.

    anonymous: "Protect your identity"
    anonymoustext: "With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to <a href=\"#protect-your-privacy#\">protect your privacy</a>."

    general: "General"
    whatisbitcoin: "What is Bitcoin?"
    whatisbitcointxt1: "Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent <a href=\"http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html\">triple entry bookkeeping system</a> in existence."
    creator: "Who created Bitcoin?"
    creatortxt1: "Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called \"cryptocurrency\", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with <a href=\"#development#\">many developers</a> working on Bitcoin."
    creatortxt2: "Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper."
    whocontrols: "Who controls the Bitcoin network?"
    whocontrolstxt1: "Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus."
    howitworks: "How does Bitcoin work?"
    howitworkstxt1: "From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users."
    howitworkstxt2: "Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the \"block chain\". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called \"mining\". To learn more about Bitcoin, you can consult the <a href=\"#how-it-works#\">dedicated page</a> and the <a href=\"#bitcoin-paper#\">original paper</a>."
    used: "Is Bitcoin really used by people?"
    usedtxt1: "Yes. There is a <a href=\"http://usebitcoins.info/\">growing number of businesses</a> and individuals using Bitcoin. This includes brick and mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, law firms, and popular online services such as Namecheap, WordPress, and Reddit. While Bitcoin remains a relatively new phenomenon, it is growing fast. At the end of August 2013, the <a href=\"https://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/\">value of all bitcoins in circulation</a> exceeded US$ 1.5 billion with millions of dollars worth of bitcoins exchanged daily."
    acquire: "How does one acquire bitcoins?"
    acquireli1: "As payment for goods or services."
    acquireli2: "Purchase bitcoins at a <a href=\"https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com\">Bitcoin exchange</a>."
    acquireli3: "Exchange bitcoins with <a href=\"https://localbitcoins.com/\">someone near you</a>."
    acquireli4: "Earn bitcoins through competitive <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinmining.com/\">mining</a>."
    acquiretxt1: "While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback."
    makepayment: "How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?"
    makepaymenttxt1: "Bitcoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology."
    advantages: "What are the advantages of Bitcoin?"
    advantagesli1: >
      <em><b>Payment freedom</b></em> - It is possible to send and
      receive bitcoins anywhere in the world at any
      time. No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Bitcoin
      allows its users to be in full control of their money.

    advantagesli2: >
      <em><b>Choose your own fees</b></em> - There is no fee to receive
      bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay
      when spending. Higher fees can encourage faster <a
      href="#you-need-to-know##instant">confirmation</a> of your
      transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so
      it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs
      to send 1 bitcoin. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist
      merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins to fiat
      currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank
      accounts daily. As these services are based on Bitcoin, they can
      be offered for much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card
      networks.

    advantagesli3: "<em><b>Fewer risks for merchants</b></em> - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs."
    advantagesli4: "<em><b>Security and control</b></em> - Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Bitcoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Bitcoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption."
    advantagesli5: "<em><b>Transparent and neutral</b></em> - <a href=\"https://www.biteasy.com/\">All information</a> concerning the Bitcoin money supply itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable."
    disadvantages: "What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?"
    disadvantagesli1: "<em><b>Degree of acceptance</b></em> - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin. Every day, more businesses accept bitcoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to benefit from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">network effects</a>."
    disadvantagesli2: "<em><b>Volatility</b></em> - The <a href=\"https://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/\">total value</a> of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small events, trades, or business activities can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will decrease as Bitcoin markets and the technology matures. Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out."
    disadvantagesli3: "<em><b>Ongoing development</b></em> - Bitcoin software is still in beta with many incomplete features in active development. New tools, features, and services are being developed to make Bitcoin more secure and accessible to the masses. Some of these are still not ready for everyone. Most Bitcoin businesses are new and still offer no insurance. In general, Bitcoin is still in the process of maturing."
    trust: "Why do people trust Bitcoin?"
    trusttxt1: "Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted."
    makemoney: "Can I make money with Bitcoin?"
    makemoneytxt1: "You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules."
    makemoneytxt2: "Bitcoin is a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to grow even though it has developed at a very fast rate so far. Investing time and resources on anything related to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with Bitcoin such as mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are competitive and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the risks involved in any such project."
    virtual: "Is Bitcoin fully virtual and immaterial?"
    virtualtxt1: "Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Bitcoin can be used to pay online and in physical stores just like any other form of money. Bitcoins can also be exchanged in physical form such as the <a href=\"https://www.casascius.com/\">Casascius coins</a>, but paying with a mobile phone usually remains more convenient. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual."
    anonymous: "Is Bitcoin anonymous?"
    anonymoustxt1: "Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records. <a href=\"#protect-your-privacy#\">Various mechanisms</a> exist to protect users' privacy, and more are in development. However, there is still work to be done before these features are used correctly by most Bitcoin users."
    anonymoustxt2: "Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Bitcoin. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems. Bitcoin cannot be more anonymous than cash and it is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. Additionally, Bitcoin is also designed to prevent a large range of financial crimes."
    lost: "What happens when bitcoins are lost?"
    losttxt1: "When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins still remain in the block chain just like any other bitcoins. However, lost bitcoins remain dormant forever because there is no way for anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available, the ones that are left will be in higher demand and increase in value to compensate."
    scale: "Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?"
    scaletxt1: "The Bitcoin network can already process a much higher number of transactions per second than it does today. It is, however, not entirely ready to scale to the level of major credit card networks. Work is underway to lift current limitations, and future requirements are well known. Since inception, every aspect of the Bitcoin network has been in a continuous process of maturation, optimization, and specialization, and it should be expected to remain that way for some years to come. As traffic grows, more Bitcoin users may use lightweight clients, and full network nodes may become a more specialized service. For more details, see the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability\">Scalability</a> page on the Wiki."
    legal: "Legal"
    islegal: "Is Bitcoin legal?"
    islegaltxt1: "To the best of our knowledge, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country\">Bitcoin has not been made illegal</a> by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges."
    islegaltxt2: "Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies."
    illegalactivities: "Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?"
    illegalactivitiestxt1: "Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks."
    illegalactivitiestxt2: "Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures."
    illegalactivitiestxt3: "Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used and well-established. The use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems, and Bitcoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood. The Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this."
    regulated: "Can Bitcoin be regulated?"
    regulatedtxt1: "The Bitcoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of nearly all its users, who choose what software they use. Attempting to assign special rights to a local authority in the rules of the global Bitcoin network is not a practical possibility. Any rich organization could choose to invest in mining hardware to control half of the computing power of the network and become able to block or reverse recent transactions. However, there is no guarantee that they could retain this power since this requires to invest as much than all other miners in the world."
    regulatedtxt2: "It is however possible to regulate the use of Bitcoin in a similar way to any other instrument. Just like the dollar, Bitcoin can be used for a wide variety of purposes, some of which can be considered legitimate or not as per each jurisdiction's laws. In this regard, Bitcoin is no different than any other tool or resource and can be subjected to different regulations in each country. Bitcoin use could also be made difficult by restrictive regulations, in which case it is hard to determine what percentage of users would keep using the technology. A government that chooses to ban Bitcoin would prevent domestic businesses and markets from developing, shifting innovation to other countries. The challenge for regulators, as always, is to develop efficient solutions while not impairing the growth of new emerging markets and businesses."
    taxes: "What about Bitcoin and taxes?"
    taxestxt1: "Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin."
    consumer: "What about Bitcoin and consumer protection?"
    consumertxt1: "Bitcoin is freeing people to transact on their own terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way to cash but they can also take part in more complex contracts. Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This allows innovative dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. Such services could allow a third party to approve or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on their money. As opposed to cash and other payment methods, Bitcoin always leaves a public proof that a transaction did take place, which can potentially be used in a recourse against businesses with fraudulent practices."
    consumertxt2: "It is also worth noting that while merchants usually depend on their public reputation to remain in business and pay their employees, they don't have access to the same level of information when dealing with new consumers. The way Bitcoin works allows both individuals and businesses to be protected against fraudulent chargebacks while giving the choice to the consumer to ask for more protection when they are not willing to trust a particular merchant."
    economy: "Economy"
    bitcoinscreated: "How are bitcoins created?"
    bitcoinscreatedtxt1: "New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called \"mining\". This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. Bitcoin miners are processing transactions and securing the network using specialized hardware and are collecting new bitcoins in exchange."
    bitcoinscreatedtxt2: "The Bitcoin protocol is designed in such a way that new bitcoins are created at a fixed rate. This makes Bitcoin mining a very competitive business. When more miners join the network, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and miners must seek efficiency to cut their operating costs. No central authority or developer has any power to control or manipulate the system to increase their profits. Every Bitcoin node in the world will reject anything that does not comply with the rules it expects the system to follow."
    bitcoinscreatedtxt3: "Bitcoins are created at a decreasing and predictable rate. The number of new bitcoins created each year is automatically halved over time until bitcoin issuance halts completely with a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. At this point, Bitcoin miners will probably be supported exclusively by numerous small transaction fees."
    whyvalue: "Why do bitcoins have value?"
    whyvaluetxt1: "Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment."
    whatprice: "What determines bitcoin’s price?"
    whatpricetxt1: "The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile."
    whatpriceimg1: "Bitcoin price over time:"
    worthless: "Can bitcoins become worthless?"
    worthlesstxt1: "Yes. History is littered with currencies that failed and are no longer used, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_gold_mark\">German Mark</a> during the Weimar Republic and, more recently, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar\">Zimbabwean dollar</a>. Although previous currency failures were typically due to hyperinflation of a kind that Bitcoin makes impossible, there is always potential for technical failures, competing currencies, political issues and so on. As a basic rule of thumb, no currency should be considered absolutely safe from failures or hard times. Bitcoin has proven reliable for years since its inception and there is a lot of potential for Bitcoin to continue to grow. However, no one is in a position to predict what the future will be for Bitcoin."
    bubble: "Is Bitcoin a bubble?"
    bubbletxt1: "A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will lead to a sudden downward correction constitutes a bubble. Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Reasons for changes in sentiment may include a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, increased press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed."
    ponzi: "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?"
    ponzitxt1: "A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Ponzi schemes are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new participants."
    ponzitxt2: "Bitcoin is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollar, euro, yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads to volatility where owners of bitcoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Bitcoin is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses."
    earlyadopter: "Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?"
    earlyadoptertxt1: "Some early adopters have large numbers of bitcoins because they took risks and invested time and resources in an unproven technology that was hardly used by anyone and that was much harder to secure properly. Many early adopters spent large numbers of bitcoins quite a few times before they became valuable or bought only small amounts and didn't make huge gains. There is no guarantee that the price of a bitcoin will increase or drop. This is very similar to investing in an early startup that can either gain value through its usefulness and popularity, or just never break through. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and it has been designed with a very long-term view; it is hard to imagine how it could be less biased towards early adopters, and today's users may or may not be the early adopters of tomorrow."
    finitelimitation: "Won't the finite amount of bitcoins be a limitation?"
    finitelimitationtxt1: "Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. However, this will never be a limitation because transactions can be denominated in smaller sub-units of a bitcoin, such as bits - there are 1,000,000 bits in 1 bitcoin. Bitcoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places (0.000 000 01) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future as the average transaction size decreases."
    deflationaryspiral: "Won't Bitcoin fall in a deflationary spiral?"
    deflationaryspiraltxt1: "The deflationary spiral theory says that if prices are expected to fall, people will move purchases into the future in order to benefit from the lower prices. That fall in demand will in turn cause merchants to lower their prices to try and stimulate demand, making the problem worse and leading to an economic depression."
    deflationaryspiraltxt2: "Although this theory is a popular way to justify inflation amongst central bankers, it does not appear to always hold true and is considered controversial amongst economists. Consumer electronics is one example of a market where prices constantly fall but which is not in depression. Similarly, the value of bitcoins has risen over time and yet the size of the Bitcoin economy has also grown dramatically along with it. Because both the value of the currency and the size of its economy started at zero in 2009, Bitcoin is a counterexample to the theory showing that it must sometimes be wrong."
    deflationaryspiraltxt3: "Notwithstanding this, Bitcoin is not designed to be a deflationary currency. It is more accurate to say Bitcoin is intended to inflate in its early years, and become stable in its later years. The only time the quantity of bitcoins in circulation will drop is if people carelessly lose their wallets by failing to make backups. With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same."
    speculationvolatility: "Isn't speculation and volatility a problem for Bitcoin?"
    speculationvolatilitytxt1: "This is a chicken and egg situation. For bitcoin's price to stabilize, a large scale economy needs to develop with more businesses and users. For a large scale economy to develop, businesses and users will seek for price stability."
    speculationvolatilitytxt2: "Fortunately, volatility does not affect the main benefits of Bitcoin as a payment system to transfer money from point A to point B. It is possible for businesses to convert bitcoin payments to their local currency instantly, allowing them to profit from the advantages of Bitcoin without being subjected to price fluctuations. Since Bitcoin offers many useful and unique features and properties, many users choose to use Bitcoin. With such solutions and incentives, it is possible that Bitcoin will mature and develop to a degree where price volatility will become limited."
    buyall: "What if someone bought up all the existing bitcoins?"
    buyalltxt1: "Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. Bitcoin markets are competitive, meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Additionally, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. Therefore even the most determined buyer could not buy all the bitcoins in existence. This situation isn't to suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation; it still doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset thus far."
    bettercurrency: "What if someone creates a better digital currency?"
    bettercurrencytxt1: "That can happen. For now, Bitcoin remains by far the most popular decentralized virtual currency, but there can be no guarantee that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative currencies inspired by Bitcoin. It is however probably correct to assume that significant improvements would be required for a new currency to overtake Bitcoin in terms of established market, even though this remains unpredictable. Bitcoin could also conceivably adopt improvements of a competing currency so long as it doesn't change fundamental parts of the protocol."
    transactions: "Transactions"
    tenminutes: "Why do I have to wait for confirmation?"
    tenminutestxt1: >
      Receiving notification of a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there
      is a delay before the network begins to
      confirm your transaction by including it in a block.
      A confirmation means that
      there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received
      haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property.
      Once your transaction has been included in one block, it will
      continue to be buried under every block after it, which will
      exponentially consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of
      a reversed transaction.
      Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and 90 minutes, with
      10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a
      fee or is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can
      take much longer.  Every user is free to determine at what
      point they consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but <a href="#you-need-to-know##instant">6 confirmations</a>
      is often considered to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit
      card transaction.

    fee: "How much will the transaction fee be?"
    feetxt1: >
      Transactions can be processed without fees, but trying to send
      free transactions can require waiting days or weeks. Although fees
      may increase over time, normal fees currently only cost a tiny
      amount. By default, all <a href="#choose-your-wallet#">Bitcoin
      wallets</a> listed on Bitcoin.org add what they think is an
      appropriate fee to your transactions; most of those wallets will
      also give you chance to review the fee before sending the
      transaction.

    feetxt2: >
      Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending
      transactions to overload the network and as a way to pay
      miners for their work helping to secure the network. The precise manner in which
      fees work is still being developed and will change over time.
      Because the fee is not related to the amount of bitcoins being
      sent, it may seem extremely low or unfairly high. Instead, the
      fee is relative to the number of bytes in the transaction, so
      using multisig or spending multiple previously-received amounts
      may cost more than simpler transactions. If your activity follows
      the pattern of conventional transactions, you won't have to pay
      unusually high fees.

    poweredoff: "What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?"
    poweredofftxt1: "This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins."
    sync: "What does \"synchronizing\" mean and why does it take so long?"
    synctxt1: "Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients like Bitcoin Core. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Bitcoin transactions on the network. For some Bitcoin clients to calculate the spendable balance of your Bitcoin wallet and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions. This step can be resource intensive and requires sufficient bandwidth and storage to accommodate the full size of the block chain. For Bitcoin to remain secure, enough people should keep using full node clients because they perform the task of validating and relaying transactions."
    mining: "Mining"
    whatismining: "What is Bitcoin mining?"
    whatisminingtxt1: "Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as \"mining\" as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins. Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued."
    howminingworks: "How does Bitcoin mining work?"
    howminingworkstxt1: "Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created bitcoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula."
    howminingworkstxt2: "For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with a mathematical proof of work. Such proofs are very hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than by trying billions of calculations per second. This requires miners to perform these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the difficulty of finding valid blocks is automatically increased by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no individual miner can control what is included in the block chain."
    howminingworkstxt3: "The proof of work is also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this requires the recalculation of the proofs of work of all the subsequent blocks. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners work on the first block they receive and switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power."
    howminingworkstxt4: "Bitcoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network because all Bitcoin nodes would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted."
    miningwaste: "Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?"
    miningwastetxt1: "Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured."
    miningwastetxt2: "Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware consuming less energy, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn't actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it."
    miningsecure: "How does mining help secure Bitcoin?"
    miningsecuretxt1: "Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction."
    miningstart: "What do I need to start mining?"
    miningstarttxt1: "In the early days of Bitcoin, anyone could find a new block using their computer's CPU. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased greatly to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining today is using specialized hardware. You can visit <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinmining.com/\">BitcoinMining.com</a> for more information."
    security: "Security"
    secure: "Is Bitcoin secure?"
    securetxt1: "The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record, and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ sound <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">security practices</a> to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance against theft or loss."
    hacked: "Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?"
    hackedtxt1: "The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, <a href=\"/en/alerts\">security flaws</a> have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity."
    hackedtxt2: "There are often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, none of them involve Bitcoin itself being hacked, nor imply inherent flaws in Bitcoin; just like a bank robbery doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However, it is accurate to say that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions is needed to give users better protection of their money, and to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last few years, such security features have quickly developed, such as wallet encryption, offline wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-signature transactions."
    collude: "Could users collude against Bitcoin?"
    colludetxt1: "It is not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol that easily. Any Bitcoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Therefore, It is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar."
    colludetxt2: "However, powerful miners could arbitrarily choose to block or reverse recent transactions. A majority of users can also put pressure for some changes to be adopted. Because Bitcoin only works correctly with a complete consensus between all users, changing the protocol can be very difficult and requires an overwhelming majority of users to adopt the changes in such a way that remaining users have nearly no choice but to follow. As a general rule, it is hard to imagine why any Bitcoin user would choose to adopt any change that could compromise their own money."
    quantum: "Is Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?"
    quantumtxt1: "Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/6021/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix/\">quantum computing</a> could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Bitcoin users."

With selective accounting transparency, digital contracts, and irreversible transactions, Bitcoin can be used as a ground to restore trust and agreement. Crooked banks cannot cheat the system to make a profit at the expense of other banks or the public. A future in which major banks would support Bitcoin could help to reinstate integrity and trust in financial institutions."
    resiliency: "Resilience and decentralization"

Bitcoin could represent an interesting step forward in securing local and global financial systems."
    transparency: "Flexible transparency"
    transparencytext: "All Bitcoin transactions are public and transparent and the identity of the people behind the payments is private by default.

    title: "Protect your privacy - Bitcoin"
    pagetitle: "Protect your privacy"
    pagedesc: "Bitcoin is often perceived as an anonymous payment network. But in reality, Bitcoin is probably the most transparent payment network in the world. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide acceptable levels of privacy when used correctly. <b>Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy</b>."
    traceable: "Understanding Bitcoin traceability"
    traceabletxt: "Bitcoin works with an unprecedented level of transparency that most people are not used to dealing with. All Bitcoin transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin addresses are the only information used to define where bitcoins are allocated and where they are sent. These addresses are created privately by each user's wallets. However, once addresses are used, they become tainted by the history of all transactions they are involved with. Anyone can see the <a href=\"https://www.biteasy.com\">balance and all transactions</a> of any address. Since users usually have to reveal their identity in order to receive services or goods, Bitcoin addresses cannot remain fully anonymous. As the block chain is permanent, it's important to note that something not traceable currently may become trivial to trace in the future. For these reasons, Bitcoin addresses should only be used once and users must be careful not to disclose their addresses."
    receive: "Use new addresses to receive payments"
    receivetxt: "To protect your privacy, you should use a new Bitcoin address each time you receive a new payment. Additionally, you can use multiple wallets for different purposes. Doing so allows you to isolate each of your transactions in such a way that it is not possible to associate them all together. People who send you money cannot see what other Bitcoin addresses you own and what you do with them. This is probably the most important advice you should keep in mind."
    public: "Be careful with public spaces"
    publictxt: "Unless your intention is to receive public donations or payments with full transparency, publishing a Bitcoin address on any public space such as a website or social network is not a good idea when it comes to privacy. If you choose to do so, always remember that if you move any funds with this address to one of your other addresses, they will be publicly tainted by the history of your public address. Additionally, you might also want to be careful not to publish information about your transactions and purchases that could allow someone to identify your Bitcoin addresses."
    iplog: "Your IP address can be logged"
    iplogtxt: "Because the Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network, it is possible to listen for transactions' relays and log their IP addresses. Full node clients relay all users' transactions just like their own. This means that finding the source of any particular transaction can be difficult and any Bitcoin node can be mistaken as the source of a transaction when they are not. You might want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> so that it cannot be logged."
    mixing: "Limitations of mixing services"
    mixingtxt: "Some online services called mixing services offer to mix traceability between users by receiving and sending back the same amount using independent Bitcoin addresses. It is important to note that the legality of using such services might vary and be subjected to different rules in each jurisdiction. Such services also require you to trust the individuals running them not to lose or steal your funds and not to keep a log of your requests. Even though mixing services can break traceability for small amounts, it becomes increasingly difficult to do the same for larger transactions."
    future: "Future improvements"
    futuretxt: "Many improvements can be expected in the future to improve privacy. For instance, some efforts are ongoing with the payment messages API to avoid tainting multiple addresses together during a payment. Bitcoin Core change addresses might be implemented in other wallets over time. Graphical user interfaces might be improved to provide user friendly payment request features and discourage addresses reuse. Various work and research is also being done to develop other potential extended privacy features like being able to join random users' transactions together."

    pagetitle: "Securing your wallet"
    summary: "Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value anywhere in a very easy way and it allows you to be in control of your money. Such great features also come with great security concerns. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. <b>Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money</b>."
    everyday: "Small amounts for everyday uses"
    everydaytxt: "A Bitcoin wallet is like a wallet with cash. If you wouldn't keep a thousand dollars in your pocket, you might want to have the same consideration for your Bitcoin wallet. In general, it is a good practice to keep only small amounts of bitcoins on your computer, mobile, or server for everyday uses and to keep the remaining part of your funds in a safer environment."
    online: "Be careful with online services"
    onlinetxt: "You should be wary of any service designed to store your money online. Many exchanges and online wallets suffered from security breaches in the past and such services generally still do not provide enough insurance and security to be used to store money like a bank. Accordingly, you might want to use other types of <a href=\"#choose-your-wallet#\">Bitcoin wallets</a>. Otherwise, you should choose such services very carefully. Additionally, using two-factor authentication is recommended."
    backup: "Backup your wallet"
    backuptxt: "Stored in a safe place, a backup of your wallet can protect you against computer failures and many human mistakes.  It can also allow you to recover your wallet after your mobile or computer was stolen if you keep your wallet encrypted."
    backupwhole: "Backup your entire wallet"
    backupwholetxt: "Some wallets use many hidden private keys internally. If you only have a backup of the private keys for your visible Bitcoin addresses, you might not be able to recover a great part of your funds with your backup."
    backuponline: "Encrypt online backups"
    backuponlinetxt: "Any backup that is stored online is highly vulnerable to theft. Even a computer that is connected to the Internet is vulnerable to malicious software. As such, encrypting any backup that is exposed to the network is a good security practice."
    backupmany: "Use many secure locations"
    backupmanytxt: "Single points of failure are bad for security. If your backup is not dependent of a single location, it is less likely that any bad event will prevent you to recover your wallet. You might also want to consider using different medias like USB keys, papers and CDs."
    backupregular: "Make regular backups"
    backupregulartxt: "You need to backup your wallet on a regular basis to make sure that all recent Bitcoin change addresses and all new Bitcoin addresses you created are included in your backup. However, all applications will be soon using wallets that only need to be backed up once."
    encrypt: "Encrypt your wallet"
    encrypttxt: "Encrypting your wallet or your smartphone allows you to set a password for anyone trying to withdraw any funds. This helps protect against thieves, though it cannot protect against keylogging hardware or software."
    encryptforget: "Never forget your password"
    encryptforgettxt: "You should make sure you never forget the password or your funds will be permanently lost. Unlike your bank, there are very limited password recovery options with Bitcoin. In fact, you should be able to remember your password even after many years without using it. In doubt, you might want to keep a paper copy of your password in a safe place like a vault."
    encryptstrong: "Use a strong password"
    encryptstrongtxt: "Any password that contains only letters or recognizable words can be considered very weak and easy to break. A strong password must contain letters, numbers, punctuation marks and must be at least 16 characters long. The most secure passwords are those generated by programs designed specifically for that purpose. Strong passwords are usually harder to remember, so you should take care in memorizing it."
    offline: "Offline wallet for savings"
    offlinetxt: "An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings. It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network. When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities. Using an offline wallet in conjunction with backups and encryption is also a good practice. Here is an overview of some approaches."
    offlinetx: "Offline transaction signing"
    offlinetxtxt1: "This approach involves having two computers sharing some parts of the same wallet. The first one must be disconnected from any network. It is the only one that holds the entire wallet and is able to sign transactions. The second computer is connected to the network and only has a watching wallet that can only create unsigned transactions. This way, you can securely issue new transactions with the following steps."
    offlinetxtxt2: "Create a new transaction on the online computer and save it on an USB key."
    offlinetxtxt3: "Sign the transaction with the offline computer."
    offlinetxtxt4: "Send the signed transaction with the online computer."
    offlinetxtxt5: "Because the computer that is connected to the network cannot sign transactions, it cannot be used to withdraw any funds if it is compromised. <a href=\"https://bitcoinarmory.com/tutorials/armory-advanced-features/offline-wallets/\">Armory</a> can be used to do offline transaction signature."
    hardwarewallet: "Hardware wallets"
    hardwarewallettxt: "Hardware wallets are the best balance between very high security and ease of use. These are little devices that are designed from the root to be a wallet and nothing else. No software can be installed on them, making them very secure against computer vulnerabilities and online thieves. Because they can allow backup, you can recover your funds if you lose the device."
    update: "Keep your software up to date"
    updatetxt: "Using the latest version of your Bitcoin software allows you to receive important stability and security fixes. Updates can prevent problems of various severity, include new useful features and help keep your wallet safe. Installing updates for all other software on your computer or mobile is also important to keep your wallet environment safer."
    offlinemulti: "Multi-signature to protect against theft"
    offlinemultitxt: "Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require multiple independent approvals to be spent. This can be used by an organization to give its members access to its treasury while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. Some web wallets also provide multi-signature wallets, allowing the user to keep control over their money while preventing a thief from stealing funds by compromising a single device or server."
    offlinetestament: "Think about your testament"
    offlinetestamenttxt: "Your bitcoins can be lost forever if you don't have a backup plan for your peers and family. If the location of your wallets or your passwords are not known by anyone when you are gone, there is no hope that your funds will ever be recovered. Taking a bit of time on these matters can make a huge difference."
