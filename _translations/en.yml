    owntxt: "Bitcoin.org is the original domain name used with the first Bitcoin website. It was registered and is still managed by <a href=\"#development#\">Bitcoin core developers</a> and by additional community members, with the input of <a href=\"#community#\">Bitcoin communities</a>. Bitcoin.org is not an official website. Just like nobody owns the email technology, nobody owns the Bitcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Bitcoin."

    controltxt: "Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. Developers are improving the software but they can't force a change in the rules of the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work decently with a complete consensus between all users. Therefore, all users and developers have strong incentives to adopt and protect this consensus."

    pagetitle: "Bitcoin for Businesses"
    summary: "Bitcoin is a very secure and inexpensive way to handle payments."
    lowfee: "The lowest fees out there"
    lowfeetext: "Bitcoin's high cryptographic security allows it to process transactions in a very efficient and inexpensive way. You can make and receive payments using the Bitcoin network with almost no fees. In most cases, fees are not strictly required but they are recommended for faster confirmation of your transaction."
    fraud: "Protection against payment and chargeback fraud"
    fraudtext: "Any business that accepts credit card or PayPal payments knows the problem of payments that are later reversed because the sender's account was hacked or they fraudulently claimed non-delivery. The only way businesses can defend themselves against this kind of fraud is with complex risk analysis and increased prices to cover the losses. Bitcoin payments are irreversible and wallets can be kept highly secure, meaning that the cost of theft is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of the merchants."
    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: "Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. In fact, bitcoins never have any real physical location, so it is possible to transfer as many of them anywhere with no limits, delays, or excessive fees. There are no intermediate banks to make you wait three business days."
    pci: "No PCI compliance required"
    pcitext: "Accepting credit cards online typically requires extensive security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. While it is a good thing to protect credit cards, Bitcoin security is built in such a way that makes this approach obsolete. Your payments are secured by the network, not at your expense."
    visibility: "Get some free visibility"
    visibilitytext: "Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their coins. Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has always shown to be a clever practice for online businesses."
    multisig: "Multi-signature"
    multisigtext: "Bitcoin also includes a feature, not yet well known, which allows coins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people sign the transaction (so-called \"n of m\" transactions). This is the equivalent of the good old multi-signature cheque system that you might still use with banks today."
    transparency: "Accounting transparency"
    transparencytext: "Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity and to adopt good transparency practices. Using Bitcoin offers the highest level of transparency since your balance and your transactions are public for your members so long as you keep them aware of your Bitcoin addresses."

    simple: "The simplest of all payment systems"
    simpletext: "Unless payment needs to be associated with automatic invoices, accepting money is as simple as adding a Bitcoin address to a website as a bitcoin: link or QR code. This very simple setup is within reach of any user and can fulfill the needs of a good range of clients. It's especially suitable for donations."
    api: "Many third party APIs"
    apitext: "There are many third party payment processing services that provide APIs; you don't need to store bitcoins on your server and handle the security that this implies. At the same time, most of these APIs allow you to exchange your bitcoins into your local currency at competitive costs."
    own: "You can be your own financial system"
    owntext: "If you don't use any third party APIs, you can integrate a Bitcoin server directly in your applications, allowing you to become your own bank and payment processor. With all the responsibilities that this implies, you can build amazing systems that process Bitcoin transactions with almost no fees."
    invoice: "Bitcoin addresses to track invoices"
    invoicetext: "Bitcoin can create as many Bitcoin addresses as you want. So if you were to build a payment system associated with an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Bitcoin address for each payment. You can also use the same addresses once the payment is done."
    security: "Most of the security is on client side"
    securitytext: "Most parts of the security are handled by the protocol on the client and Bitcoin network side. Authenticity is verified through private keys, and double-spends are prevented through the Bitcoin network. That means no need for PCI compliance nor fraud detection. We love things that just work, don't we?"
    micro: "Cheap micro payments"
    microtext: "Bitcoin offers the lowest payment processing fees for any type of transaction, including micro-payments. This means that it can also be used to design and implement new creative online services that could not exist before only because of financial limitations."

    international: "Fast international payments"
    internationaltext: "Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, level outrageous fees, or freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country."

    simpletext: "Just like with email, you don't need to force your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites.

    lowfee: "Almost free to use"
    lowfeetext: "Bitcoin allows you to send and receive payments at very low cost. Except for special cases like micro-payments, there is no enforced fee. It is however recommended to pay a higher voluntary fee for faster confirmation of your transaction and to remunerate the people who operate the Bitcoin network." 
    anonymous: "Protect your identity"
    anonymoustext: "With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you.

    pagetitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    summary: "Find answers to recurring questions and myths about Bitcoin."
    table: "Table of contents"
    general: "General"    
    whatisbitcoin: "What is Bitcoin?"
    whatisbitcointxt1: "Bitcoin is a payment system and open-source software platform that enables a new, completely digital money called bitcoins (BTC). It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen and it can also be seen as a <a href=\"http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html\">triple entry bookkeeping system</a>."
    creator: "Who created Bitcoin?"
    creatortxt1: "Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. By the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project without revealing much about himself. Meanwhile, the community has grown with <a href=\"#development#\">many developers</a> working on Bitcoin."
    creatortxt2: "The anonymity of Satoshi often raised unjustified concerns due to a misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The protocol and software have been published in such a way that any developer around the world can review the code and make different Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi had limited influence and he didn't control Bitcoin. Trying to find who invented Bitcoin today is probably as relevant as trying to find who invented paper."
    whocontrols: "Who controls the Bitcoin network?"
    whocontrolstxt1: "Just like nobody owns the technology behind email, nobody owns the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus between all users. Therefore, all users and developers have strong incentives to adopt and protect this consensus. This also means that if something is wrong, all users and developers have incentives to help fixing the problem."
    howitworks: "How does Bitcoin work?"
    howitworkstxt1: "From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that creates and stores Bitcoin addresses and allows the user to send and receive bitcoins. That pretty much sums up how Bitcoin works for the average user."
    howitworkstxt2: "Behind the scenes, the whole Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the block chain. This ledger contains every Bitcoin transaction ever processed on the network, allowing your computer to verify the validity of each transaction. All Bitcoin users can create an essentially limitless number of Bitcoin addresses. These addresses define where bitcoins are sent to and where they come from. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending address. All users have full control over sending bitcoins from his or her own Bitcoin addresses. Anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called \"mining\". To learn more about how Bitcoin works, you can consult the <a href=\"#how-it-works#\">dedicated page</a> and the <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\">original paper</a>."
    used: "Is Bitcoin really used by people?"
    usedtxt1: "Yes. There is a <a href=\"http://usebitcoins.info/\">growing number of businesses</a> and individuals using Bitcoin, including real world businesses like restaurants and popular services such as Namecheap, WordPress and Flattr. While Bitcoin remains a relatively small phenomenon, it is growing fast. During August 2013, the <a href=\"http://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap\">value of all bitcoins in circulation</a> was over 1.4 billion US$ with millions of dollars exchanged daily through up to 70,000 transactions."
    acquire: "How does one acquire bitcoins?"
    acquireli1: "Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services."
    acquireli2: "Buy bitcoins at one of the <a href=\"http://howtobuybitcoins.info\">Bitcoin exchanges</a>."
    acquireli3: "Trade traditional currency for bitcoins with <a href=\"https://localbitcoins.com/\">someone near you</a>."
    acquireli4: "Earn bitcoins through competitive <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinmining.com/\">mining</a>."
    acquiretxt1: "While it is possible to find individuals who wish to sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to repeated cases where someone pays for bitcoins with PayPal, receives their bitcoins, and then succesfully reverse the transaction."
    makepayment: "How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?"
    makepaymenttxt1: "Bitcoin payments are easier to make than existing banking or credit card process. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. The recipient's address can be saved in your address book. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address into a transaction, many wallets can obtain the recipient address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology. Of course, a simple copy/paste works too."
    advantages: "What are the advantages of Bitcoin?"
    advantagesli1: "<em><b>Payment freedom</b></em> - It is possible to send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No imposed limits. Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money."
    advantagesli2: "<em><b>Low or zero fees</b></em> - Bitcoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions by receiving bitcoins, converting them to fiat currency, and directly deposit the funds to the merchants account daily. As these services are based on Bitcoin, they can be offered for much lower fees and less risk than with PayPal or credit card networks."
    advantagesli3: "<em><b>Fewer risks for merchants</b></em> - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks and there is no need for PCI compliance. Consequently, merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs."
    advantagesli4: "<em><b>More protection for consumers</b></em> - Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with ACH debits, debit cards, PayPal, and credit cards. Bitcoin payments can be made without needing personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft."
    advantagesli5: "<em><b>Transparent and neutral</b></em> - <a href=\"http://blockchain.info\">All information</a> concerning the Bitcoin money supply is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate Bitcoin protocol. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being fully neutral, transparent and predictable."
    disadvantages: "What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?"
    disadvantagesli1: "<em><b>Not widely accepted</b></em> - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Every day, more businesses accept bitcoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to benefit from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\"> networking effects.</a>"
    disadvantagesli2: "<em><b>Volatile</b></em> - The <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap\">total value</a> of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will decrease as the markets and technology matures. Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out."
    disadvantagesli3: "<em><b>Still in development</b></em> - New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses but some user tools are still not ready for everyone. More intuitive and advanced security solutions are being developed but are not currently used. Most Bitcoin businesses are new and most of them don't offer any insurance. In general, Bitcoin is still in the process of maturing."
    trust: "Why do people trust Bitcoin?"
    trusttxt1: "Many people trust Bitcoin because it requires absolutely no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source. Everyone has access to all of the source code all of the time, allowing any developer in the world to verify what it does. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be done without involving trust in a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used in online banking. The network is decentralized; no organization or individual can control Bitcoin and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted."
    makemoney: "Can I make money with Bitcoin?"
    makemoneytxt1: "You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. As a general rule, it is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules."
    makemoneytxt2: "Bitcoin, just like any new market, can offer various business opportunities that also include risks. There is no garantee that Bitcoin will continue to grow even though it has developed at a very fast rate so far. Investing time and resources on anything related to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with Bitcoin such as mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are very competitive and cannot garantee a profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evalution of the costs and the risks of such projects."
    virtual: "Is Bitcoin fully virtual and immaterial?"
    virtualtxt1: "Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks that people are using everyday. It can be used to pay online and in physical stores just like other forms of money. Bitcoins can also be exchanged as physical coins like the Casascius coins but paying with a mobile remains more convenient. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other terms, Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish because they are virtual."
    anonymous: "Is Bitcoin anonymous?"
    anonymoustxt1: "Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other legitimate form of money. It is however not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records. Various mechanisms exist or are being developed to protect users privacy. However, there is still work to be done before these features are used correctly by the majority of all Bitcoin users."
    anonymoustxt2: "Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Bitcoin. However, it is worth to note that Bitcoin is no more anonymous than cash and the use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems. Additionally, Bitcoin is designed to prevent a large range of financial crimes and it is not likely to prevent criminal investigations to be conducted."
    lost: "What happens when bitcoins are lost?"
    losttxt1: "When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins still remain in the block chain just like any other bitcoins. However, lost bitcoins remain dormant forever because there is no chance for anybody to find the private key that would allow to spend them again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available the ones that are left will be in higher demand. So, as bitcoins are lost, bitcoins will eventually increase in value to compensate. This can be seen as a global redistribution of wealth through deflation."
    scale: "Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?"
    scaletxt1: "The Bitcoin network can already process a much higher number of transactions per second than today. It is however not entirely ready to scale to the level of a credit card network. Ongoing work is already being done to lift current limitations and future requirements are well known. Since its inception, every single part of the Bitcoin network has been in a continuous process of maturation, optimization and specialization and it should be expected to remain that way for years to come. As traffic grows and this becomes more critical, more Bitcoin users will use lightweight clients and full network nodes will become a more specialized service. For more details, see the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability\">Scalability</a> page on the Wiki."
    legal: "Legal"
    islegal: "Is Bitcoin legal?"
    islegaltxt1: "To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in any jurisdiction. However, some jurisdictions severely restrict or ban all foreign currency like Argentina."
    islegaltxt2: "Additionally, regulators from various jurisdictions have taken steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology into businesses and other activities. For example, the United States' FinCEN has issued non-binding and non-determinative guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies."
    illegalactivities: "Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?"
    illegalactivitiestxt1: "Bitcoin is money and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and traditional banking systems largely surpass Bitcoin in terms of financing crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of those innovations are thought to be way beyond their potential drawbacks."
    illegalactivitiestxt2: "Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unwanted charges like those used in credit card frauds. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption and multi-signature."
    illegalactivitiestxt3: "Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive for illegal actors because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are useful and perfectly legal. The use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems and Bitcoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations to be conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood. Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this observation."
    regulated: "Can Bitcoin be regulated?"
    regulatedtxt1: "The Bitcoin protocol in itself cannot be modified against the will of its users because every user in the world is free to choose what software they use and what virtual currency they believe is the most useful. Therefore any attempt to take control of the network is doomed not to succeed and would rather end up creating a new competing virtual currency."
    regulatedtxt2: "It is however possible to regulate the use of Bitcoin in a similar way than any other instrument. Just as the dollar, Bitcoin can be used for a wide range of reasons, some of which can be considered legitimate or not as per each jurisdiction laws. In this regard, Bitcoin is no different than any other tool or resource and can be subjected to different regulations in each country. The real challenge for regulators, as always, is to develop and apply efficient solutions while not impairing the growth of new emerging markets and businesses."
    taxes: "What about Bitcoin and taxes?"
    taxestxt1: "Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin."
    economy: "Economy"
    bitcoinscreated: "How the bitcoins are being created?"
    bitcoinscreatedtxt1: "New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called mining. This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. More specifically, miners are processing transactions and securing the network using specialized hardware and are collecting new bitcoins in exchange."
    bitcoinscreatedtxt2: "The Bitcoin protocol is designed in such a way that no more than a fixed amount of Bitcoin can be created approximately each 10 minutes. This makes Bitcoin mining a very competitive business. When more miners join the network, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and miners must seek for efficiency to cut their operating costs. No central authority or developer has any power to control or manipulate the system to increase their profits. Every Bitcoin node in the world will reject anything that doesn't comply with the rules it expects the system to follow."
    bitcoinscreatedtxt3: "Bitcoins are created at a decreasing and predictable rate. The number of new bitcoins created each year is automatically halved over time until bitcoins issuance completely halt with a market cap of 21 millions bitcoins in existence. At this point, Bitcoin miners will probably be supported exclusively by numerous small transaction fees."
    whyvalue: "Why do bitcoins have value?"
    whyvaluetxt1: "Bitcoins have value because they are useful and because they are scarce. Technically speaking, Bitcoin have all the attributes of money (fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on the physical properties of a rock like gold or trust in a politically issued currency. In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to gain value is trust and acceptance. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants and startups."
    whatprice: "What determines Bitcoin’s price?"
    whatpricetxt1: "The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. There is only a certain amount of bitcoins in circulation and this amount is owned and divided between all Bitcoin users. Therefore when there is more demand for bitcoins, the price increases and when there is less demand, the price decreases. New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must equate to this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin still hold a relatively small market compared to what it could be, the price of a bitcoin is very volatile."
    whatpriceimg1: "Bitcoin price, 2011 to 2013:"
    worthless: "Can bitcoins become worthless?"
    worthlesstxt1: "Yes. History is littered with currencies that failed and are no longer used, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_gold_mark\">German Mark</a> during the Wiemar Republic or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar\">Zimbabwean dollar</a> more recently. Although previous currency failures were typically due to hyperinflation of a kind that Bitcoin makes impossible, there is always potential for technical failures, competing currencies, political issues and so on. As a basic rule of thumb, no currency should be considered absolutely safe from failures or hard times. Bitcoin prooved its reliability for a few years and there is a lot of potential for it continue to grow. However, no one is in a position to predict what will be the future for Bitcoin."
    bubble: "Is Bitcoin a bubble?"
    bubbletxt1: "A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble. Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, excessive press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and just old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed."
    ponzi: "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?"
    ponzitxt1: "A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individual running the operation."
    ponzitxt2: "Bitcoin is an open-source software project with no central authority and consequently no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollars, Euros, Yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate freely floats. This can lead to volatility where owners of bitcoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Bitcoin is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses."
    earlyadopter: "Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?"
    earlyadoptertxt1: "Some early adopters have a large number of bitcoins now because they took risks and invested time or resources on an unproven technology that was hardly used by anyone and that was much harder to secure properly. Many of them also spent a great part of their bitcoins quite a few times or bought only small amounts and didn't make huge gains. The Bitcoin market is a free market and there is no garantee that the price will increase or drop. This is very similar to investing in a early startup that is either gaining value through its usefulness and popularity over time, or just never break through. Bitcoin is still at its infancy and it has been designed with a very long-term view, it is hard to imagine how it could be less tilted towards early adopters and today's users might or might not be the early adopters of tomorrow."
    finitelimitation: "Won't the finite amount of bitcoins be a limitation?"
    finitelimitationtxt1: "Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 millions bitcoins will ever be created. However, this will never be a limitation because bitcoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places ( 0.000 000 01 BTC ) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future. As the average transaction size reduces, transactions can be denominated in sub-units of a bitcoin such as mBTC ( 0.001 BTC ), µBTC ( 0.000 001 BTC ) or satoshis ( 0.000 000 01 BTC )."
    deflationaryspiral: "Won't Bitcoin fall in a deflationary spiral?"
    deflationaryspiraltxt1: "The deflationary spiral theory says that if prices are expected to fall, people will move purchases into the future in order to benefit from the lower prices. That fall in demand will in turn cause merchants to lower their prices to try and stimulate demand, making the problem worse and leading to an economic depression."
    deflationaryspiraltxt2: "Although this theory is a popular way to justify inflation amongst central bankers, it does not appear to always hold true and is considered controversial amongst economists. Consumer electronics are one example of a market where prices constantly fall and yet is not in depression. Likewise, over time the value of bitcoins have risen and yet the size of the Bitcoin economy has also grown dramatically along with it. Because both the value of the currency and size of its economy started at zero in January 2009, Bitcoin is an existence proof that the theory must sometimes be wrong."
    deflationaryspiraltxt3: "Despite all this Bitcoin is not designed to be a deflationary currency. It is more accurate to say Bitcoin is intended to inflate in its early years, and become stable in the later years. The only time the quantity of bitcoins in circulation will drop is if people carelessly lose their wallets by failing to make backups. With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same."
    speculationvolatility: "Isn't speculation and volatility a problem for Bitcoin?"
    speculationvolatilitytxt1: "This is a chicken and egg situation. For Bitcoin price to stabilize, a large scale economy needs to develop with more businesses and users. For a large scale economy to develop, businesses and users will seek for price stability."
    speculationvolatilitytxt2: "Fortunately, it is possible for businesses to convert their payments in their local currency instantly, allowing them to profit of the advantages of Bitcoin without being subjected to price fluctuations. Since Bitcoin offers many useful and unique features and properties, many users also choose to use Bitcoin. With such solutions and incentives, it is possible that Bitcoin will succeed to mature and develop to a degree where price volatility will decrease."
    buyall: "What if someone bought up all the existing Bitcoins?"
    buyalltxt1: "Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. Bitcoin markets are competitive, meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Additionally, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades. Therefore even the most determined buyer could not buy all bitcoins. This situation doesn't suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation. It doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset."
    bettercurrency: "What if someone creates a better digital currency?"
    bettercurrencytxt1: "That can happen. As for now, Bitcoin remains by far the first and foremost private decentralized virtual currency but there can't be any guarantees that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative currencies inspired by Bitcoin. It is however probably correct to assume that significant improvements would be required for a new  currency to outrace Bitcoin in terms of esthablished market, even though this remains unpredictable."
    transactions: "Transactions"
    tenminutes: "Why do I have to wait 10 minutes?"
    tenminutestxt1: "Receiving a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there is a 10 minutes delay on average before the network confirms your transaction by including it in a block and before you can spend the bitcoins you receive. A confirmation means that there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been confirmed, it will continue to receive additional confirmations that will exponentially consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction."
    fee: "How much will the transaction fee be?"
    feetxt1: "Most transactions can be processed without fees but users are encouraged to pay a small fee by their own for faster confirmation of their transactions and to remunerate the miners. When fees are required, they generally don't exceed a few pennies in value. The most recent version of the Bitcoin client will estimate an appropriate fee when required."
    feetxt2: "Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network. The precise manner in which fees work is still being developed and will change over time. Because the fee is related to the amount of data in the transaction and not to the amount of bitcoins being sent, it may seem extremely low (0.0005 BTC for a 1,000 BTC transfer) or unfairly high (0.004 BTC for a 0.02 BTC payment). If you are receiving large number of tiny amounts, then fees when sending will be higher because this payment could be compared to paying a restaurant bill using only penny coins. If your activity follows the pattern of conventional transactions, the fees should remain very low."
    poweredoff: "What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?"
    poweredofftxt1: "This works fine. The money will appear next time you start your wallet app. Bitcoins are not actually sent to your wallet in your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all software on the network. If you are sent coins when your wallet client program is not running, and you later launch the wallet client program, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about and the coins will eventually appear as if they were just received in the wallet. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend coins."
    sync: "What does \"synchronizing\" means and why is it taking so long?"
    synctxt1: "Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients like Bitcoin-Qt. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Bitcoin transactions on the network. For a Bitcoin client to calculate the spendable balance of your Bitcoin addresses and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions that have been completed on the Bitcoin network. This step can be resource consuming and requires to have enough bandwidth and storage for the full <a href=\"http://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size\">block chain size</a>. For Bitcoin to remain secure, enough people should keep using full node clients because they perform the task of validating and relaying transactions."
    mining: "Mining"
    whatismining: "What is Bitcoin mining?"
    whatisminingtxt1: "Mining is the process of spending computation power to process transactions, secure the network and keeps everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners in all countries and no individual having control over the network. Mining is called this way because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue bitcoins in a very similar way to a scarse commodity like gold. However as opposed to gold, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange of a useful work required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued."
    howminingworks: "How does Bitcoin mining work?"
    howminingworkstxt1: "Anybody can become a miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software is listening for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and perform appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this labor because they can earn transaction fees paid by customers for faster transaction processing and newly created coins, issued into existence according to a fixed formula."
    howminingworkstxt2: "For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with mathematic proofs of work. Such proofs are very hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than trying millions of random calculations. Because of that, miners are forced to do these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the difficulty of finding valid blocks is automatically increased by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes on average. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no miner can control what is included in the block chain."
    howminingworkstxt3: "Proof of works are also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this would require to recalculate the proof of works of all following blocks. Therefore, transactions become more secure each time they are confirmed by a new block. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners are designed to switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power."
    howminingworkstxt4: "Bitcoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network because all Bitcoin node would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted."
    miningwaste: "Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?"
    miningwastetxt1: "Spending energy on securing and operating a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other service, the use of Bitcoin is implying processing costs that are covered by the usefulness of the services offered. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks and credit card companies, also spend a lot of energy. So does any goods or services people are using or buying every day. However as opposed to Bitcoin, this global energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be measured publicly."
    miningwastetxt2: "Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware using less energy consumption and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to the demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable, some miners choose to stop their activities."
    miningsecure: "How does mining help secure Bitcoin?"
    miningsecuretxt1: "Mining creates the equivalence of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions in the block chain. This allows to protect the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual to gain the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual to replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Additionally, mining makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because it would require to rewrite all blocks following this transaction."
    miningstart: "What do I need to start mining?"
    miningstarttxt1: "In the early days, anyone could find new blocks using standard computers CPUs. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks has greatly increased to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining is using specialized hardware (ASICs). You can visit <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinmining.com/\">BitcoinMining.com</a> for more informations."
    security: "Security"
    secure: "Is Bitcoin secure?"
    securetxt1: "The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Bitcoin's vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash in a computer or mobile. Fortunately, users can employ <a href=\"#secure-your-wallet#\">security practices</a> to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance. Bitcoins are not covered by insurance schemes or depositor insurance like the FDIC, but users' wallets could be with a service provider that offers that provision."
    hacked: "Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?"
    hackedtxt1: "The Bitcoin protocol in itself has never suffered from a security breach and is still working great after years, which is a fairly good indication that the concept is well designed. However, <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/en/alerts\">security flaws</a> have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity."
    hackedtxt2: "There is often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, in none of them Bitcoin has been hacked, just like a bank being robbed doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However it is true that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions need to be developped around Bitcoin to help users having a better control and protection of their money and continue to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last years, such security features developed at a fast rate like wallet encryption, offline wallets, multi-signature and hardware wallets."
    collude: "Could users collude against Bitcoin?"
    colludetxt1: "It isn't possible to change the Bitcoin protocol with a majority of users or miners. Any miner that doesn't comply with the protocol immediately generates a chain fork as the rest of the network is rejecting blocks from these miners, including all Bitcoin clients that are not mining. As per the current specification, no double spending is possible on the same block chain nor spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Consequently, it is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users funds, corrupt the network or anything similar."
    colludetxt2: "However, a majority of miners could arbirarily choose to block or reverse targeted recent transactions. This could be used for censorship purposes or to defraud targeted merchants. But this can also be used for legitimate purposes, like applying a collaborative emergency action to help fixing a problem with the network like the <a href=\"/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork\">march 2013 chain fork</a>"
    quantum: "Isn't Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?"
    quantumtxt1: "Yes, and so is all system relying on cryptography in general including current banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that quantum computing could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use new algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Bitcoin users."
    crackedshutdown: "Can't Bitcoin be cracked or shutdown?"
    crackedshutdowntxt1: "Bitcoin has been designed to be a very resilient technology in order to be reliable as a global financial tool. The way it works is very similar to other decentralized networks such as the Internet, with no single point of failure. No individual or developer have control over Bitcoin and as long as some users and miners remain, the network will continue existing. This high level of resiliency and redundancy is unmatched in the payments space and can represent an important breakthrough for the protection of financial systems that are still highly dependent on a small number of data centers."
    crackedshutdowntxt2: "Even though technical failures are possible, Bitcoin has demonstrated its ability to withstand various forms of attacks for years and the discovery of new technical issues would likely only lead to further improvements. Bitcoin use could however be made difficult by severe regulations, in which case it is hard to determine what percentage of users would keep using the technology. However, because Bitcoin is a global network that is deployed in every country, a government that would choose to censor Bitcoin or make it illegal would prevent businesses and markets to develop on its own territory and potentially fall behind other countries in terms of innovation with payment systems."

Bitcoin can offer an alternative to previous cumbersome and costly systems, and it can increase online business access to developing countries."
    freedom: "Protecting individual rights and freedom"
    freedomtext: "Bitcoin allows people to securely store and exchange value on a network that cannot be seized, manipulated, or stopped by any organization or individual. It gives many powerful tools to the people so that it is easier to protect individual rights against various levels of corruption."
    global: "The first neutral global currency"
    globaltext: "Not often in our history has money been disconnected from any political influence or national economy. Could Bitcoin be the first global currency to cross all barriers between nations, politics, and cultures for the benefit of the common good? It certainly looks like it might happen. One for all and all for one!"
    transparency: "Promoting transparency"
    transparencytext: "All Bitcoin transactions are public, but the owners or recipients of these transactions are not. Organizations can choose to reveal their ownership of some Bitcoin addresses to their members, allowing them to implement high levels of transparency."
    secure: "Making money more secure"
    securetext: "Thanks to a clever use of strict cryptographic rules, Bitcoin provides an amazing list of security features. Not only are bitcoins impossible to counterfeit or spoof, but the protocol is also built to be very resistant against an impressive list of attacks, including distributed denial of service."
    trust: "Solving issues with trust in banks"
    trusttext: "Bitcoin offers solutions to many of the trust problems that plague banks thanks to selective accounting transparency, signature proofs, and irreversible transactions. It also increases the risks for crooked bankers: no bitcoins can be created to save them from their own mistakes at the expense of the people."

    pagetitle: "Securing your wallet"
    summary: "Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value anywhere in a very easy way and it allows you to be in control of your money. Such great features also come with great security concerns. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. <b>Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money</b>."
    online: "Be careful with online services"
    onlinetxt: "Online wallets and exchanges look like online banks. However, you should always choose such services carefully. As of today, these services generally don't provide enough insurance and security to be used to store your money like a bank. Using security features like two-factor authentication can help to increase the security of your acccounts."
    backup: "Backup your wallet"
    backuptxt: "Bitcoin services and software allow you to backup your wallet. Stored in a safe place, a backup can protect you against computer failures and many human mistakes."
    backupwhole: "Backup your entire wallet"
    backupwholetxt: "Your wallet contains many private keys that receive the change of your transactions in order to protect your privacy. If you only have a backup of the private keys for your visible Bitcoin addresses, you might not be able to recover a great part of your funds with your backup."
    backuponline: "Encrypt online backups"
    backuponlinetxt: "Any backup that is stored online is highly vulnerable to theft. Even a computer that is connected to the Internet is vulnerable to malicious software. As such, encrypting any backup that is exposed to the network is a good security practice."
    backupmany: "Use many secure locations"
    backupmanytxt: "Single points of failure are bad for security. If your backup is not dependent of a single location, it is less likely that any bad event will prevent you to recover your wallet. You might also want to consider using different medias like USB keys, papers and CDs."
    backupregular: "Make regular backups"
    backupregulartxt: "You need to backup your wallet on a regular basis to make sure that all recent Bitcoin change addresses and all new Bitcoin addresses you created are included in your backup. However, all applications will be soon using wallets that only need to be backed up once."
    encrypt: "Encrypt your wallet"
    encrypttxt: "Encrypting your wallet allows you to set a password for anyone trying to withdraw any funds. This helps protect against thieves, though it cannot protect against keylogging hardware or software."
    encryptforget: "Never forget your password"
    encryptforgettxt: "You should make sure you never forget the password or your funds will be permanently lost. Unlike your bank, there are no password recovery options with Bitcoin. In fact, you should be able to remember your password even after many years without using it. In doubt, you might want to keep a paper copy of your password in a safe place like a vault."
    encryptstrong: "Use a strong password"
    encryptstrongtxt: "Any password that contains only letters or recognizable words can be considered very weak and easy to break. A strong password must contain letters, numbers, punctuation marks and must be at least 16 characters long. Still, this should not prevent you to remember your password."
    offline: "Offline wallet for savings"
    offlinetxt: "An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings. It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network. When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities. Using an offline wallet in conjunction with backups and encryption is also a good practice. Here is an overview of some approaches."
    offlinetx: "Offline transaction signing"
    offlinetxtxt1: "This approach involves having two computers sharing some parts of the same wallet. The first one must be disconnected from any network. It is the only one that holds the entire wallet and is able to sign transactions. The second computer is connected to the network and only have a watching wallet that can only create unsigned transactions. This way, you can securely issue new transactions with the following steps."
    offlinetxtxt2: "Create a new transaction on the online computer and save it on an USB key."
    offlinetxtxt3: "Sign the transaction with the offline computer."
    offlinetxtxt4: "Send the signed transaction with the online computer."
    offlinetxtxt5: "Because the computer that is connected to the network cannot sign transactions, it cannot be used to withdraw any funds if it is compromised. <a href=\"https://bitcoinarmory.com/using-offline-wallets-in-armory/\">Armory</a> can be used to do offline transaction signature."
    hardwarewallet: "Hardware wallets"
    hardwarewallettxt: "Hardware wallets are the best balance between very high security and ease of use. They are little devices that are designed from the root to be a wallet and nothing else. No software can be installed on them, making them very secure against computer vulnerabilities and online thieves. Because they can allow backup, you can recover your funds if you lose the device."
    hardwarewalletsoon: "As of today, no hardware wallet has entered in production but they are coming soon:"
    offlinemulti: "Multi-signature to protect against theft"
    offlinemultitxt: "Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require the signature of more than one private key to be spent. It is however only usable for technical users but a greater availability for this feature can be expected in the future. Multi-signature can allow an organization to give access to its treasury to its members while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. It can also allow future online wallets to share a multi-signature address with their users, so that a thief would need to compromise both your computer and the online wallet servers in order to steal your funds."
    offlinemobile: "Small amounts on your mobile"
    offlinemobiletxt: "A Bitcoin wallet on your phone is like a wallet with cash. If you wouldn't keep a thousand dollar in your pocket, you might want to have the same consideration for your Bitcoin wallet. You can easily add more funds at any time on your mobile. This way, you can combine security with ease of use."
    offlinetestament: "Think about your testament"
    offlinetestamenttxt: "Your bitcoins can be lost forever if you don't have a backup plan for your peers and family. If the location of your wallets or your passwords are not known by anyone when you are gone, there is no hope that your funds will ever be recovered. Taking a bit of time on these matters can make a huge difference."

Although for larger amounts (e.g. 1000 US$ and above), one can wait for a transaction to have more confirmations - six is a frequently chosen number. Each new confirmation decreases the risk of a reversal exponentially."
    cryptography: "Cryptography"
    cryptographytxt: "Cryptography is the branch of mathematics that lets us create <b>mathematical proofs that provide high levels of security</b>. Online commerce and banking already uses cryptography. In the case of Bitcoin, cryptography is used to make it impossible for anybody to spend funds from another user's wallet or to corrupt the <a href=\"#[vocabulary.blockchain]\">block chain</a>.

    mining: "Mining"
    miningtxt: "Bitcoin mining is the process of <b>making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions</b> and increase security. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm, along with newly created bitcoins. Mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done. Not all Bitcoin users do Bitcoin mining, and it is not an easy way to make money."

    volatile: "Bitcoin price is volatile"
    volatiletxt: "The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings in bitcoin is not recommended at this point. Bitcoin should be considered as a high risk asset, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many service providers allow you to convert them instantly to your local currency."
    irreversible: "Bitcoin payments are irreversible"
    irreversibletxt: "Any transaction you issue with Bitcoin cannot be reversed, it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds. That means you should take care to do business with people or organizations you know and trust. But don't worry, Bitcoin can detect typos and usually won't let you send money to an invalid address."
    anonymous: "Bitcoin is not anonymous"
    anonymoustxt: "Some effort is required in order to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the owner cannot be associated with their Bitcoin address until personal information is revealed by the owner during an exchange. This is why it is recommended for Bitcoin owners to use many different Bitcoin addresses; in fact, you should create a new one each time you receive money. This is especially important for public uses such as websites. You might also want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> so that it cannot be logged."
    instant: "Instant transactions are less secure"
    instanttxt: "A Bitcoin transaction is usually deployed within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. During that time, a transaction can be considered authentic but still reversible. Dishonest users could try to cheat. If you can't wait for a confirmation, asking for a small transaction fee or using a detection system for unsafe transactions can increase security. For larger amounts like 1000 US$, it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more. Each confirmation <i>exponentially</i> decreases the risk of a reversed transaction."
    experimental: "Bitcoin is still experimental"
    experimentaltxt: "Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Although it becomes less experimental as usage grows, you should keep in mind that Bitcoin is a new invention that is exploring ideas that have never been attempted before. As such, its future cannot be predicted by anyone."
    tax: "Don't forget government taxes"
