FIX
Menu: Documentation don't have any translation

JS: clean up the files. At the moment two $ can be live and 
the site is loading to many js files.

jQuery: Choose witch version is possible to use.

flags: fix the flags. they are little of.

Translate: Make the footer_developer translate ready

footer_developer: Make the bottom part little larger see mockup

footer_standard: make the text right align


REFACTOR
header_standard.js need to refactor. 

header_standard.less need to refactor.

At the moment js,less,html files are spread out in diffrent
component folders. Check with site owners if its possible 
to create a single folder put all files into a single folder,
because it will be a lot of work if somebody objects. 

_components
	---	header_standard
		--- header_standard.html
		--- header_standard.less
		--- header_standard.js
		--- header_standard--menu.svg
		etc.
