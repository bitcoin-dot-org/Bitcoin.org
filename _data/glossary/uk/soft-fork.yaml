    summary_max_255_characters_no_formatting: >
        A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol 
        wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions 
        are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise 
        the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible.

        - Fork (a regular fork where all nodes follow the same consensus rules, so the fork is resolved once one chain has more proof of work than another)
        - Hard fork (a permanent divergence in the block chain caused by non-upgraded nodes not following new consensus rules)
        - Software fork (when one or more developers permanently develops a codebase separately from other developers)
        - Git fork (when one or more developers temporarily develops a codebase separately from other developers
