    title_max_40_characters_no_formatting: Minimum Relay Fee

    summary_max_255_characters_no_formatting: >
        The minimum transaction fee a transaction must pay (if it isn't
        a high-priority transaction) for a full node to relay that
        transaction to other nodes. There is no one minimum relay
        fee---each node chooses its own policy.
