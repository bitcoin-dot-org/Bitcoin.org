        - Fork (a regular fork where all nodes follow the same consensus rules, so the fork is resolved once one chain has more proof of work than another)
        - Soft fork (a temporary divergence in the block chain caused by non-upgraded nodes not following new consensus rules)
        - Software fork (when one or more developers permanently develops a codebase separately from other developers)
        - Git fork (when one or more developers temporarily develops a codebase separately from other developers
