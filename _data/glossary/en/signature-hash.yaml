    summary_max_255_characters_no_formatting: >
        A flag to Bitcoin signatures that indicates what parts of the
        transaction the signature signs.  (The default is SIGHASH_ALL.)
        The unsigned parts of the transaction may be modified.

    not_to_be_confused_with_capitalize_first_letter:
        - Signed hash (a hash of the data to be signed)
        - Transaction malleability / transaction mutability (although non-default sighash flags do allow optional malleability, malleability comprises any way a transaction may be mutated)
