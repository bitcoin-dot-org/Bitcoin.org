{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% assign summary_getBlock="gets a block with a particular header hash from the local block database either as a JSON object or as a serialized block." %}

The `getblock` RPC {{summary_getBlock}}

*Parameter #1---header hash*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Header Hash"
  t: "string (hex)"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The hash of the header of the block to get, encoded as hex in RPC byte order"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #2---whether to get JSON or hex output*
Prior to 0.15.0 release the verbose parameter was of boolean type. After the 0.15.0 release, the variable has been renamed to `verbosity` and now takes an integer from 0 to 2. It is backward compatible with prior releases with verbose level 0 equivalent to verbose=false, whilst verbose level 1 is equivalent to verbose=true.

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Format"
  t: "number"
  p: "Optional<br>(0, 1 or 2)"
  d: "Set to `0` to get the block in serialized block format; set to `1` (the default) to get the decoded block as a JSON object; set to `2` to get the decoded block as a JSON object with verbose transaction decoding"

{% enditemplate %}

*Result (if format was `0`)---a serialized block*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "`result`"
  t: "string (hex)/null"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The requested block as a serialized block, encoded as hex, or JSON `null` if an error occurred"

*Example from Bitcoin Core 0.13.1*

Get a block in raw hex:

{% highlight bash %}
bitcoin-cli getblock \
            00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 \
            false
{% endhighlight %}

Result (wrapped):

{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

Get the same block in JSON:

{% highlight bash %}
bitcoin-cli getblock \
            00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048
