  pagetitle: "Innovation in payment systems"
  summary: "Bitcoin is a major innovation in the world of payments. Just like these inventions that seemed impossible until their time has come, Bitcoin is real and it might become part of our everyday lifes. A wide range of new exciting possibilities are still to be discovered in years to come. Here is a short overview of the technology and some recent developments."
  collaboration: "Worldwide collaboration"
  collaborationtext: " Because of its open-source nature, Bitcoin is the first payment network to be powered by its users with no central authority. Developers cannot change the system without user's consent and every user benefits of the global economy growth and prosperity. If something is wrong with something related to Bitcoin, users have incentives to help fixing the problem. Bitcoin created an economy that rewards global collaboration."
  control: "Security and control"
  controltext: "Bitcoin provides an unprecedented level of security. It is impossible to counterfeit bitcoins and the network provides users with protection against many types of frauds like chargebacks or unwanted charges. Users can backup or encrypt their wallet and hardware wallets could make it nearly impossible to steal money in the future. Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to have complete control over their money."
  cost: "Cost efficiency"
  costtext: "With the use of cryptography, secure payments are possible without slow and costly middlemen. A Bitcoin transaction can be much cheaper than its alternatives and be completed in a short time. This means Bitcoin hold some potential to become a common way to transfer any currency in the future. Bitcoin could also play a role in reducing proverty in many countries by cutting high transaction fees on worker's salary."
  global: "Global payment network"
  globaltext: "All payments everywhere in the world can be fully interoperable. Bitcoin allows any bank, business or individual to securely send and receive payments with each other anywhere at any time. Bitcoin is available in a large number of countries that still remain out of reach for most payment systems due to their own limitations. Bitcoin increases global access to online commerce and it can help international trades to flourish."
  transparency: "Flexible transparency"
  transparencytext: "All Bitcoin transactions are public and transparent and the identity of the people behind the payments is private by default. This allows individuals and organizations to work with flexible transparency rules. For instance, a business can choose to reveal certain transactions and balances only to certain employees just like a non-profit organization is free to allow the public to see how much they receive through donations."
  trust: "Solving issues with trust"
  trusttext: "Bitcoin offers solutions to many of the trust problems that plague banks. With selective accounting transparency, digital contracts, and irreversible transactions, Bitcoin can be used as a ground to restore trust and agreement. Crooked banks cannot cheat the system to make a profit at the expense of other banks or the public. A future in which major banks would support Bitcoin could help to reinstate integrity and trust in financial institutions."
  resiliency: "Resiliency and decentralization"
  resiliencytext: "By its high decentralization, Bitcoin created a different form of payment network with an increased level of resilience and redundancy. Bitcoin can handle millions of dollars in trades without requiring military protection. With no central point of failure such as a data center, attacking the network is a more difficult project. For this reason, Bitcoin could represent an interesting step forward in securing financial systems."
  predictable: "Predictability and neutrality"
  predictabletext: "Bitcoin is the first form of money to be fully neutral, transparent and predictable. Because Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, the payment network and the number of bitcoins in circulation cannot be manipulated. There is no closed doors, central money issuer or any other form of authority. Bitcoin is a fully automated financial system. As an unprecedented experiment, it will be very exciting to discover what Bitcoin will accomplish."
  multisig: "Multi-signature accounts"
  multisigtext: "Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This feature could be used by a board of directors to prevent any member to spend parts of their treasury without other member's consent. This can also be used by banks to prevent theft by blocking transactions above a certain threshold if the user do not provide additional credentials."
  mediation: "Dispute mediation"
  mediationtext: "Bitcoin can be used to develop innovative dispute mediation services using multiple signatures. Such services could make it possible for a third party to approve or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on their money. Since these services would be compatible with any user and merchant using Bitcoin, this would likely lead to free competition and higher quality standards."
  micro: "Micro payments"
  microtext: "Bitcoin can process payments to the scale of a dollar and soon even much smaller amounts. Such payments are routine even today. Imagine listening to internet radio paid by the second, viewing web pages with a small tip for each ad not shown, or buying bandwidth from a WiFi hotspot by the kilobyte. Bitcoin is efficient enough to make all of these ideas possible. <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/WorkingWithMicropayments\">Learn more</a> about the technology behind Bitcoin micro payments."
  donation: "Tips and donations"
  donationtext: "Bitcoin has been a particularly efficient solution for tips and donations in several cases. Sending a payment only requires one click and receiving donations can be as simple as displaying a QR code. Donations can be visible for the public, giving increased transparency for non-profit organizations. In cases of emergencies such as natural disasters, Bitcoin donations could contribute to a faster international response."
  crowdfunding: "Crowdfunding"
  crowdfundingtext: "Although not yet easy to use, Bitcoin can be used to run Kickstarter-style crowdfunding campaigns, in which individuals pledge money to a project that is taken from them only if enough pledges are received to meet the target. Such assurance contracts are processed by the Bitcoin protocol, which prevents a transaction to take place until all conditions have been met. <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_3:_Assurance_contracts\">Learn more</a> about the technology behind crowdfunding."
