<h1>Some things you need to know</h1>
<h1>Bitcoin 使用須知</h1>

<p>If you are about to explore Bitcoin, there are a few things you should know. Bitcoin does not let you send emails or take pictures; it lets you exchange money and value. As such, Bitcoin must be treated with the same care as your regular wallet, or even more in some cases!</p>
<p>在你踏入 Bitcoin 世界之前，有些需要先知道的事。 Bitcoin 是能夠交換真實世界的金錢或等值物品的貨幣，不是用來拍照或收發電子郵件的工具。你必須像看待口袋裡的皮夾一樣地看待 Bitcoin，有時候甚至要更加謹慎！

<h2><img src="/img/ico_key.svg" alt="Security" />保管你的錢包</h2>

<p>Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money. Here are some options you should consider.</p>
<p>你要學會好的習慣來保護 Bitcoin 錢包的安全，就像在日常生活裡保管自己的皮夾那樣。下面是一些你應該考慮的作法。</P>

<div class="box">
<h3>Backup your wallet</h3>
<h3>備份錢包</h3>
<p>Bitcoin services and software allow you to backup your wallet, which can be printed on paper or saved to a USB drive. Stored in a safe place, a backup can protect you against computer failure and many human mistakes.</p>
<p>Bitcoin 和它的程式允許你用列印在紙上或存在隨身碟的方式備份自己的錢包。妥當收好你的備份，在電腦故障或操作錯誤的時候就要用到它了。</p>

<h3>Encrypt your wallet</h3>
<h3>對錢包加密</h3>
<p>Encrypting your wallet allows you to set a password for anyone trying to withdraw any funds. This helps protect against thieves and hackers, though it cannot protect against keylogging hardware or software. However, you should make sure you never forget the password or your funds will be permanently lost. Unlike your bank, there are no password recovery options with Bitcoin!</p>
<p>你可以設定從 Bitcoin 錢包裡拿錢時需要輸入密碼。密碼在面臨小偷和駭客入侵時提供了多一層保障，但你仍然要提防壞人透過軟硬體側錄打字內容盜取它。另外，千萬不要忘記你設定的密碼！Bitcoin 與一般銀行不同，如果忘記密碼的話是沒有其他方式重置密碼和提款的！</p>

<h3>Be careful with online wallets</h3>
<h3>謹慎使用網路錢包</h3>
<p>Using an online wallet is pretty much like using an online bank. You are trusting someone else to protect your money while you have to remember and protect your password. You should always choose such services carefully. As of today, no online wallet provides enough insurance and security to be used to store value like a bank.</p>
<p>Bitcoin 網路錢包的服務和一般網路銀行很像。小心地選擇服務提供者，你信任其他人來保護你的財產，而你要記住和保護自己的密碼。同時也不要忘記，直至今日網路錢包還未能提供像實體銀行同等級的保障。</p>

<h3>Use an offline backup for savings</h3>
<h3>離線備份錢包</h3>
<p>An offline backup of a wallet provides the highest level of security for savings. It involves storing a wallet only on paper and on usb keys in different secured locations that are not connected to the network. This is a good protection against computer failures, computer vulnerabilities, theft and human mistakes. As of today, this approach still requires some technical knowledge to be done correctly.</p>
<p>離線備份是對你的財產最高等級的保障方式。實際的作法可以是將錢包列印在紙上或是存到隨身碟裡，保管在其他安全的地方，一個無法透過網路連線到達的地方。這個方式能保護你不受到電腦故障、程式漏洞、小偷和人為誤操作的影響。為了正確地做到離線備份，你需要對相關技術有基本的瞭解。</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_market.svg" alt="Volatile" />Bitcoin price is volatile</h2>
<h2>Bitcoin 匯率波動不定</h2>
<p>The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings in bitcoin is not recommended. Bitcoin should be considered as a high risk asset, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many service providers allow you to convert them instantly to your local currency.</p>
<p>因為 Bitcoin 是金融界的新生兒，它運作方式新穎但偶爾有不容易兌現的麻煩，造成的結果是 Bitcoin 短期匯率走勢捉摸不定。它是一種高風險的資產，不要將你無法承擔損失的金額投入其中，Bitcoin 並不是儲蓄的好選擇。許多 Bitcoin 服務的提供者都允許你在收到 Bitcoin 的付款後立刻兌現。</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_irreversible.svg" alt="Irreversible" />Bitcoin payments are irreversible</h2>
<h2>Bitcoin 付款是不可逆的</h2>
<p>Any transaction you issue with Bitcoin cannot be reversed. It can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds. That means you should take care to do business with people or organizations you know and trust. But don't worry, Bitcoin can detect typos and usually won't let you send money to an invalid address.</p>
<p>你沒有辦法取消付出去的 Bitcoin，取回款項的唯一方法是透過你付款的對象退回你的錢。所以，慎選你進行交易的人或組織，他們必須是你瞭解或信任的對象。Bitcoin 能偵測錯誤的拼字，通常你無法匯錢給無效的帳號，你可以稍微放心打錯字的問題。</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_anon.svg" alt="Anonymous" />Bitcoin is not anonymous without efforts</h2>
<h2>努力維護 Bitcoin 的匿名性</h2>
<p>All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anybody can see the balance and the transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, it is not possible to associate a Bitcoin address with its physical owner unless the owner demonstrated that they own it. This is why it is recommended to use many different Bitcoin addresses; in fact, you should create a new one each time you receive money. This is especially important for public uses such as websites. You might also want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> so that it cannot be logged by others.</p>
<p>所有 Bitcoin 的交易記錄都是公開並永久地留在網際網路上，任何人都可以查看任何 Bitcoin 帳號內的金額和交易。這不代表透過 Bitcoin 帳號可以找出它的真實持有者，除非有人跳出來公開展示他持有某帳號。我們建議你使用多個 Bitcoin 帳號，事實上你每次都應該創建一個新帳號來進行收款，尤其是在像網站上公開使用時這個動作更是重要。同時，你也可以利用像 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a></p> 這類工具隱藏自己電腦的 IP 位址，以免被其他人留下記錄。

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lab.svg" alt="Experimental" />Bitcoin is still experimental</h2>
<h2>Bitcoin 仍在實驗階段</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Although it becomes less and less experimental as usage grows, you should keep in mind that Bitcoin is a new invention that is exploring ideas that have never been attempted before. As such, its future cannot be predicted by anyone.</p>
<p>Bitcoin 仍持續在發展中，是一種實驗性的新貨幣。僅管隨著使用次數的成長 Bitcoin 越來越像一回事，你仍該謹記在心它是一項嶄新的發明，而且不斷地在探索前所未見的想法，沒有人能預測 Bitcoin 會有一個怎麼樣的未來。</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_invoice.svg" alt="Taxes" />Don't forget government taxes</h2>
<h2>別忘了納稅</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is not an official currency. That said, most jurisdictions still require you to pay income, sales, payroll, and capital gains taxes on anything that has value, including Bitcoin..</p>
<p>Bitcoin 不是一種官方貨幣。大部分的稽稅機關仍會要求你基於任何有價值的收入、營業所得、薪水、資產利得納稅，包括 Bitcoin。</p>
