- **Legal:** Bitcoin use is [prohibited or restricted in some
  areas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country)

- **Bandwidth limits**: Some Internet plans will charge an additional
  amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn't included in
  the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without
  warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your
  Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your
  bandwidth use so that you can stop Bitcoin Core before you reach your
  upload limit.

- **Anti-virus:** Several people have placed parts of known computer
  viruses in the Bitcoin blockchain. This blockchain data can't infect
  your computer, but some anti-virus programs quarantine the data
  anyway, making it more difficult to run Bitcoin Core. This problem mostly
  affects computers running Windows.

- **Attack target:** Bitcoin Core powers the Bitcoin peer-to-peer
  network, so people who want to disrupt the network may
  attack Bitcoin Core users in ways that will affect other things
  you do with your computer, such as an attack that limits your
  available download bandwidth.
