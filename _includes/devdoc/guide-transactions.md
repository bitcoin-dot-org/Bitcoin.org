                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

when I'm terribly bored, I should rewrite this whole transaction section
to use those terms and then get feedback to see if it actually helps. -harding -->

Transactions let users spend satoshis. Each transaction is constructed
out of several parts which enable both simple direct payments and complex
transactions. This section will describe each part and
demonstrate how to use them together to build complete transactions.

To keep things simple, this section pretends coinbase transactions do
not exist. Coinbase transactions can only be created by Bitcoin miners
and they're an exception to many of the rules listed below. Instead of
pointing out the coinbase exception to each rule, we invite you to read
about coinbase transactions in the block chain section of this guide.

![The Parts Of A Transaction](/img/dev/en-tx-overview.svg)

The figure above shows the main parts of a Bitcoin transaction. Each
transaction has at least one input and one output. Each [input][/en/glossary/input]{:#term-input}{:.term} spends the
satoshis paid to a previous output. Each [output][/en/glossary/output]{:#term-output}{:.term} then waits as an Unspent
Transaction Output (UTXO) until a later input spends it. When your
Bitcoin wallet tells you that you have a 10,000 satoshi balance, it really
means that you have 10,000 satoshis waiting in one or more UTXOs.

Each transaction is prefixed by a four-byte [transaction version number][]{:#term-transaction-version-number}{:.term} which tells
Bitcoin peers and miners which set of rules to use to validate it.  This
lets developers create new rules for future transactions without
invalidating previous transactions.

![Spending An Output](/img/dev/en-tx-overview-spending.svg)

An output has an implied index number based on its location in the
transaction---the first output is output zero. The output also has an
amount in satoshis which it pays to a conditional pubkey script. Anyone
who can satisfy the conditions of that pubkey script can spend up to the
amount of satoshis paid to it.

An input uses a transaction identifier (txid) and an output index number
(often called "vout" for output vector) to identify a particular output to
be spent. It also has a signature script which allows it to provide data
parameters that satisfy the conditionals in the pubkey script. (The sequence
number and locktime are related and will be covered together in
a later subsection.)

The figures below help illustrate how these features are used by
showing the workflow Alice uses to send Bob a transaction and which Bob
later uses to spend that transaction. Both Alice and Bob will use the
most common form of the standard Pay-To-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) transaction
type. [P2PKH][/en/glossary/p2pkh-address]{:#term-p2pkh}{:.term} lets Alice spend satoshis to a typical Bitcoin address,
and then lets Bob further spend those satoshis using a simple
cryptographic key pair.

![Creating A P2PKH Public Key Hash To Receive Payment](/img/dev/en-creating-p2pkh-output.svg)

Bob must first generate a private/public [key pair][]{:#term-key-pair}{:.term} before Alice can create the
first transaction. Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with
the secp256k1 curve; secp256k1 [private keys][/en/glossary/private-key]{:#term-private-key}{:.term} are 256 bits of random
data. A copy of that data is deterministically transformed into an secp256k1 [public
key][/en/glossary/public-key]{:#term-public-key}{:.term}. Because the transformation can be reliably repeated later, the
public key does not need to be stored.

The public key (pubkey) is then cryptographically hashed. This pubkey hash can
also be reliably repeated later, so it also does not need to be stored.
The hash shortens and obfuscates the public key, making manual
transcription easier and providing security against
unanticipated problems which might allow reconstruction of private keys
from public key data at some later point.

<!-- Editors: from here on I will typically use the terms "pubkey hash"
and "full public key" to provide quick differentiation between the
different states of a public key and to help the text better match the
space-constrained diagrams where "public-key hash" wouldn't fit. -harding -->

Bob provides the pubkey hash to Alice. Pubkey hashes are almost always
sent encoded as Bitcoin [addresses][/en/glossary/address]{:#term-address}{:.term}, which are base58-encoded strings
containing an address version number, the hash, and an error-detection
checksum to catch typos. The address can be transmitted
through any medium, including one-way mediums which prevent the spender
from communicating with the receiver, and it can be further encoded
into another format, such as a QR code containing a `bitcoin:`
URI.

Once Alice has the address and decodes it back into a standard hash, she
can create the first transaction. She creates a standard P2PKH
transaction output containing instructions which allow anyone to spend that
output if they can prove they control the private key corresponding to
Bob's hashed public key. These instructions are called the [pubkey script][/en/glossary/pubkey-script]{:#term-pubkey-script}{:.term}
or scriptPubKey.

Alice broadcasts the transaction and it is added to the block chain.
The network categorizes it as an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), and Bob's
wallet software displays it as a spendable balance.

When, some time later, Bob decides to spend the UTXO, he must create an
input which references the transaction Alice created by its hash, called
a Transaction Identifier (txid), and the specific output she used by its
index number ([output index][]{:#term-output-index}{:.term}). He must then create a [signature
script][/en/glossary/signature-script]{:#term-signature-script}{:.term}---a
collection of data parameters which satisfy the conditions Alice placed
in the previous output's pubkey script.  Signature scripts are also
called scriptSigs.

Pubkey scripts and signature scripts combine secp256k1 pubkeys
and signatures with conditional logic, creating a programmable
authorization mechanism.

![Unlocking A P2PKH Output For Spending](/img/dev/en-unlocking-p2pkh-output.svg)

For a P2PKH-style output, Bob's signature script will contain the following two
pieces of data:

1. His full (unhashed) public key, so the pubkey script can check that it
   hashes to the same value as the pubkey hash provided by Alice.

2. An secp256k1 [signature][/en/glossary/signature]{:#term-signature}{:.term} made by using the ECDSA cryptographic formula to combine
   certain transaction data (described below) with Bob's private key.
   This lets the pubkey script verify that Bob owns the private key which
   created the public key.

Bob's secp256k1 signature doesn't just prove Bob controls his private key; it also
makes the non-signature-script parts of his transaction tamper-proof so Bob can safely
broadcast them over the peer-to-peer network.

![Some Things Signed When Spending An Output](/img/dev/en-signing-output-to-spend.svg)

As illustrated in the figure above, the data Bob signs includes the
txid and output index of the previous transaction, the previous
output's pubkey script, the pubkey script Bob creates which will let the next
recipient spend this transaction's output, and the amount of satoshis to
spend to the next recipient. In essence, the entire transaction is
signed except for any signature scripts, which hold the full public keys and
secp256k1 signatures.

After putting his signature and public key in the signature script, Bob
broadcasts the transaction to Bitcoin miners through the peer-to-peer
network. Each peer and miner independently validates the transaction
before broadcasting it further or attempting to include it in a new block of
transactions.

{% endautocrossref %}

### P2PKH Script Validation
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

The validation procedure requires evaluation of the signature script and pubkey script.
In a P2PKH output, the pubkey script is:

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubkeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
~~~

{% autocrossref %}

The spender's signature script is evaluated and prefixed to the beginning of the
script. In a P2PKH transaction, the signature script contains an secp256k1 signature (sig)
and full public key (pubkey), creating the following concatenation:

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
<Sig> <PubKey> OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubkeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
~~~

{% autocrossref %}

The script language is a
[Forth-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29)
stack-based language deliberately designed to be stateless and not
Turing complete. Statelessness ensures that once a transaction is added
to the block chain, there is no condition which renders it permanently
unspendable. Turing-incompleteness (specifically, a lack of loops or
gotos) makes the script language less flexible and more predictable,
greatly simplifying the security model.

<!-- Editors: please do not substitute for the words push or pop in
sections about stacks. These are programming terms. Also "above",
"below", "top", and "bottom" are commonly used relative directions or
locations in stack descriptions. -harding -->

To test whether the transaction is valid, signature script and pubkey script operations
are executed one item at a time, starting with Bob's signature script
and continuing to the end of Alice's pubkey script. The figure below shows the
evaluation of a standard P2PKH pubkey script; below the figure is a description
of the process.

![P2PKH Stack Evaluation](/img/dev/en-p2pkh-stack.svg)

* The signature (from Bob's signature script) is added (pushed) to an empty stack.
  Because it's just data, nothing is done except adding it to the stack.
  The public key (also from the signature script) is pushed on top of the signature.

* From Alice's pubkey script, the `OP_DUP` operation is executed. `OP_DUP` pushes onto the stack
  a copy of the data currently at the top of it---in this
  case creating a copy of the public key Bob provided.

* The operation executed next, `OP_HASH160`, pushes onto the stack a hash
  of the data currently on top of it---in this case, Bob's public key.
  This creates a hash of Bob's public key.

* Alice's pubkey script then pushes the pubkey hash that Bob gave her for the
  first transaction.  At this point, there should be two copies of Bob's
  pubkey hash at the top of the stack.

* Now it gets interesting: Alice's pubkey script executes `OP_EQUALVERIFY`.
  `OP_EQUALVERIFY` is equivalent to executing `OP_EQUAL` followed by `OP_VERIFY` (not shown).

    `OP_EQUAL` (not shown) checks the two values at the top of the stack; in this
    case, it checks whether the pubkey hash generated from the full
    public key Bob provided equals the pubkey hash Alice provided when
    she created transaction #1. `OP_EQUAL` pops (removes from the top of the stack)
    the two values it compared, and replaces them with the result of that comparison:
    zero (*false*) or one (*true*).

    `OP_VERIFY` (not shown) checks the value at the top of the stack. If
    the value is *false* it immediately terminates evaluation and
    the transaction validation fails. Otherwise it pops the *true* value off the stack.

* Finally, Alice's pubkey script executes `OP_CHECKSIG`, which checks the
  signature Bob provided against the now-authenticated public key he
  also provided. If the signature matches the public key and was
  generated using all of the data required to be signed, `OP_CHECKSIG`
  pushes the value *true* onto the top of the stack.

If *false* is not at the top of the stack after the pubkey script has been
evaluated, the transaction is valid (provided there are no other
problems with it).

{% endautocrossref %}

### P2SH Scripts
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Pubkey scripts are created by spenders who have little interest what
that script does. Receivers do care about the script conditions and, if
they want, they can ask spenders to use a particular pubkey script.
Unfortunately, custom pubkey scripts are less convenient than short
Bitcoin addresses and there was no standard way to communicate them
between programs prior to widespread implementation of the BIP70 Payment
Protocol discussed later.

To solve these problems, pay-to-script-hash
([P2SH][/en/glossary/p2sh-address]{:#term-p2sh}{:.term}) transactions were created in 2012 to let
a spender create a pubkey script containing a hash of a second
script, the
[redeem script][/en/glossary/redeem-script]{:#term-redeem-script}{:.term}.

The basic P2SH workflow, illustrated below, looks almost identical to
the P2PKH workflow. Bob creates a redeem script with whatever script he
wants, hashes the redeem script, and provides the redeem script
hash to Alice. Alice creates a P2SH-style output containing
Bob's redeem script hash.

![Creating A P2SH Redeem Script And Hash](/img/dev/en-creating-p2sh-output.svg)

When Bob wants to spend the output, he provides his signature along with
the full (serialized) redeem script in the signature script. The
peer-to-peer network ensures the full redeem script hashes to the same
value as the script hash Alice put in her output; it then processes the
redeem script exactly as it would if it were the primary pubkey script, letting
Bob spend the output if the redeem script does not return false.

![Unlocking A P2SH Output For Spending](/img/dev/en-unlocking-p2sh-output.svg)

The hash of the redeem script has the same properties as a pubkey
hash---so it can be transformed into the standard Bitcoin address format
with only one small change to differentiate it from a standard address.
This makes collecting a P2SH-style address as simple as collecting a
P2PKH-style address. The hash also obfuscates any public keys in the
redeem script, so P2SH scripts are as secure as P2PKH pubkey hashes.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Standard Transactions
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

After the discovery of several dangerous bugs in early versions of
Bitcoin, a test was added which only accepted transactions from the
network if their pubkey scripts and signature scripts matched a small set of
believed-to-be-safe templates, and if the rest of the transaction didn't
violate another small set of rules enforcing good network behavior. This
is the `IsStandard()` test, and transactions which pass it are called
standard transactions.

Non-standard transactions---those that fail the test---may be accepted
by nodes not using the default Bitcoin Core settings. If they are
included in blocks, they will also avoid the IsStandard test and be
processed.

Besides making it more difficult for someone to attack Bitcoin for
free by broadcasting harmful transactions, the standard transaction
test also helps prevent users from creating transactions today that
would make adding new transaction features in the future more
difficult. For example, as described above, each transaction includes
a version number---if users started arbitrarily changing the version
number, it would become useless as a tool for introducing
backwards-incompatible features.


As of Bitcoin Core 0.9, the standard pubkey script types are:

{% endautocrossref %}

#### Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH)
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

P2PKH is the most common form of pubkey script used to send a transaction to one
or multiple Bitcoin addresses.

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey script: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Signature script: <sig> <pubkey>
~~~

#### Pay To Script Hash (P2SH)
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

P2SH is used to send a transaction to a script hash. Each of the standard
pubkey scripts can be used as a P2SH redeem script, but in practice only the
multisig pubkey script makes sense until more transaction types are made standard.

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey script: OP_HASH160 <Hash160(redeemScript)> OP_EQUAL
Signature script: <sig> [sig] [sig...] <redeemScript>
~~~

#### Multisig
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Although P2SH multisig is now generally used for multisig transactions, this base script
can be used to require multiple signatures before a UTXO can be spent.

In multisig pubkey scripts, called m-of-n, *m* is the *minimum* number of signatures
which must match a public key; *n* is the *number* of public keys being
provided. Both *m* and *n* should be opcodes `OP_1` through `OP_16`,
corresponding to the number desired.

Because of an off-by-one error in the original Bitcoin implementation
which must be preserved for compatibility, `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`
consumes one more value from the stack than indicated by *m*, so the
list of secp256k1 signatures in the signature script must be prefaced with an extra value
(`OP_0`) which will be consumed but not used.

The signature script must provide signatures in the same order as the
corresponding public keys appear in the pubkey script or redeem
script. See the description in [`OP_CHECKMULTISIG`][op_checkmultisig]
for details.

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey script: <m> <A pubkey> [B pubkey] [C pubkey...] <n> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Signature script: OP_0 <A sig> [B sig] [C sig...]
~~~

{% autocrossref %}

Although itâs not a separate transaction type, this is a P2SH multisig with 2-of-3:

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey script: OP_HASH160 <Hash160(redeemScript)> OP_EQUAL
Redeem script: <OP_2> <A pubkey> <B pubkey> <C pubkey> <OP_3> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Signature script: OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript>
~~~

#### Pubkey
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Pubkey outputs are a simplified form of the P2PKH pubkey script,
but they arenât as
secure as P2PKH, so they generally
arenât used in new transactions anymore.

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey script: <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG
Signature script: <sig>
~~~

#### Null Data
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

[Null data][/en/glossary/null-data-transaction]{:#term-null-data}{:.term}
transaction type relayed and mined by default in Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 and
later that adds arbitrary data to a provably unspendable pubkey script
that full nodes don't have to store in their UTXO database. It is
preferable to use null data transactions over transactions that bloat
the UTXO database because they cannot be automatically pruned; however,
it is usually even more preferable to store data outside transactions
if possible.

Consensus rules allow null data outputs up to the maximum allowed pubkey
script size of 10,000 bytes provided they follow all other consensus
rules, such as not having any data pushes larger than 520 bytes.

Bitcoin Core 0.9.x to 0.10.x will, by default, relay and mine null data
transactions with up to 40 bytes in a single data push and only one null
data output that pays exactly 0 satoshis:

{% endautocrossref %}

~~~
Pubkey Script: OP_RETURN <0 to 40 bytes of data>
(Null data scripts cannot be spent, so there's no signature script.)
~~~

Bitcoin Core 0.11.x increases this default to 80 bytes, with the other
rules remaining the same.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 defaults
to relaying and mining null data outputs with up to 83 bytes with any
number of data pushes, provided the total byte limit is not exceeded.
There must still only be a single null data output and it must still pay
exactly 0 satoshis.

The `-datacarriersize` Bitcoin Core configuration option allows you to
set the maximum number of bytes in null data outputs that you will relay
or mine.

#### Non-Standard Transactions
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

If you use anything besides a standard pubkey script in an output, peers
and miners using the default Bitcoin Core settings will neither
accept, broadcast, nor mine your transaction. When you try to broadcast
your transaction to a peer running the default settings, you will
receive an error.

If you create a redeem script, hash it, and use the hash
in a P2SH output, the network sees only the hash, so it will accept the
output as valid no matter what the redeem script says.
This allows payment to non-standard scripts, and as of Bitcoin Core
0.11, almost all valid redeem scripts can be spent. The exception is
scripts that use unassigned [NOP opcodes][]; these opcodes are
reserved for future soft forks and can only be relayed or mined by nodes
that don't follow the standard mempool policy.

Note: standard transactions are designed to protect and help the
network, not prevent you from making mistakes. It's easy to create
standard transactions which make the satoshis sent to them unspendable.

As of Bitcoin Core 0.9.3, standard transactions must also meet the following
conditions:

* The transaction must be finalized: either its locktime must be in the
  past (or less than or equal to the current block height), or all of its sequence
  numbers must be 0xffffffff.

* The transaction must be smaller than 100,000 bytes. That's around 200
  times larger than a typical single-input, single-output P2PKH
  transaction.

* Each of the transaction's signature scripts must be smaller than 1,650 bytes.
  That's large enough to allow 15-of-15 multisig transactions in P2SH
  using compressed public keys.

* Bare (non-P2SH) multisig transactions which require more than 3 public keys are
  currently non-standard.

* The transaction's signature script must only push data to the script
  evaluation stack. It cannot push new opcodes, with the exception of
  opcodes which solely push data to the stack.

* The transaction must not include any outputs which receive fewer than
  1/3 as many satoshis as it would take to spend it in a typical input.
  That's [currently 546 satoshis][bitcoin core fee drop commit] for a
  P2PKH or P2SH output on a Bitcoin Core node with the default relay fee.
  Exception: standard null data outputs must receive zero satoshis.

### Signature Hash Types
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

`OP_CHECKSIG` extracts a non-stack argument from each signature it
evaluates, allowing the signer to decide which parts of the transaction
to sign. Since the signature protects those parts of the transaction
from modification, this lets signers selectively choose to let other
people modify their transactions.

The various options for what to sign are
called [signature hash][/en/glossary/signature-hash]{:#term-signature-hash}{:.term} types. There are three base SIGHASH types
currently available:

* [`SIGHASH_ALL`][/en/glossary/sighash-all]{:#term-sighash-all}{:.term}, the default, signs all the inputs and outputs,
  protecting everything except the signature scripts against modification.

* [`SIGHASH_NONE`][/en/glossary/sighash-none]{:#term-sighash-none}{:.term} signs all of the inputs but none of the outputs,
  allowing anyone to change where the satoshis are going unless other
  signatures using other signature hash flags protect the outputs.

* [`SIGHASH_SINGLE`][/en/glossary/sighash-single]{:#term-sighash-single}{:.term}
  the only output signed is the one corresponding to this input (the output
  with the same output index number as this input), ensuring nobody can change
  your part of the transaction but allowing other signers to change their part
  of the transaction. The corresponding output must exist or the value "1" will
  be signed, breaking the security scheme. This input, as well as other inputs,
  are included in the signature. The sequence numbers of other inputs are not
  included in the signature, and can be updated.

The base types can be modified with the [`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`][/en/glossary/sighash-anyonecanpay]{:#term-sighash-anyonecanpay}{:.term} (anyone can
pay) flag, creating three new combined types:

* `SIGHASH_ALL|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signs all of the outputs but only
  this one input, and it also allows anyone to add or remove other
  inputs, so anyone can contribute additional satoshis but they cannot
  change how many satoshis are sent nor where they go.

* `SIGHASH_NONE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signs only this one input and
  allows anyone to add or remove other inputs or outputs, so anyone who
  gets a copy of this input can spend it however they'd like.

* `SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signs this one input and its
  corresponding output. Allows anyone to add or remove other inputs.

Because each input is signed, a transaction with multiple inputs can
have multiple signature hash types signing different parts of the transaction. For
example, a single-input transaction signed with `NONE` could have its
output changed by the miner who adds it to the block chain. On the other
hand, if a two-input transaction has one input signed with `NONE` and
one input signed with `ALL`, the `ALL` signer can choose where to spend
the satoshis without consulting the `NONE` signer---but nobody else can
modify the transaction.

<!-- TODO: describe useful combinations maybe using a 3x3 grid;
do something similar for the multisig section with different hashtypes
between different sigs -->

<!-- TODO: add to the technical section details about what the different
hash types sign, including the procedure for inserting the subscript -->

{% endautocrossref %}

### Locktime And Sequence Number
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

One thing all signature hash types sign is the transaction's [locktime][/en/glossary/locktime]{:#term-locktime}{:.term}.
(Called nLockTime in the Bitcoin Core source code.)
The locktime indicates the earliest time a transaction can be added to
the block chain.

Locktime allows signers to create time-locked transactions which will
only become valid in the future, giving the signers a chance to change
their minds.

If any of the signers change their mind, they can create a new
non-locktime transaction. The new transaction will use, as one of
its inputs, one of the same outputs which was used as an input to
the locktime transaction. This makes the locktime transaction
invalid if the new transaction is added to the block chain before
the time lock expires.

Care must be taken near the expiry time of a time lock. The peer-to-peer
network allows block time to be up to two hours ahead of
real time, so a locktime transaction can be added to the block chain up
to two hours before its time lock officially expires. Also, blocks are
not created at guaranteed intervals, so any attempt to cancel a valuable
transaction should be made a few hours before the time lock expires.

Previous versions of Bitcoin Core provided a feature which prevented
transaction signers from using the method described above to cancel a
time-locked transaction, but a necessary part of this feature was
disabled to prevent denial of service attacks. A legacy of this system are four-byte
[sequence numbers][/en/glossary/sequence-number]{:#term-sequence-number}{:.term} in every input. Sequence numbers were meant to allow
multiple signers to agree to update a transaction; when they finished
updating the transaction, they could agree to set every input's
sequence number to the four-byte unsigned maximum (0xffffffff),
allowing the transaction to be added to a block even if its time lock
had not expired.

Even today, setting all sequence numbers to 0xffffffff (the default in
Bitcoin Core) can still disable the time lock, so if you want to use
locktime, at least one input must have a sequence number below the
maximum. Since sequence numbers are not used by the network for any
other purpose, setting any sequence number to zero is sufficient to
enable locktime.

<span id="locktime_parsing_rules">Locktime itself is an unsigned 4-byte integer which can be parsed two ways:</span>

* If less than 500 million, locktime is parsed as a block height. The
  transaction can be added to any block which has this height or higher.

* If greater than or equal to 500 million, locktime is parsed using the
  Unix epoch time format (the number of seconds elapsed since
  1970-01-01T00:00 UTC---currently over 1.395 billion). The transaction
  can be added to any block whose block time is greater
  than the locktime.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Transaction Fees And Change
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Transactions pay fees based on the total byte size of the signed transaction. Fees per byte are calculated based on current demand for space in mined blocks with fees rising as demand increases.  The transaction fee is given to the
Bitcoin miner, as explained in the [block chain section][section block chain], and so it is
ultimately up to each miner to choose the minimum transaction fee they
will accept.

There is also a concept of so-called "[high-priority transactions][/en/glossary/high-priority-transaction]{:#term-high-priority-transactions}{:.term}" which spend satoshis that have not moved for a long time.

In the past, these "priority" transaction were often exempt from the normal fee requirements. Before Bitcoin Core 0.12, 50 KB of each block would be reserved for these high-priority transactions, however this is now set to 0 KB by default.  After the priority area, all transactions are prioritized based on their fee per byte, with higher-paying transactions being added in sequence until all of the available space is filled. <!-- Consider adding links to blockmaxsize and blockmaxweight options once available in the glossary. -->

As of Bitcoin Core 0.9, a [minimum fee][/en/glossary/minimum-relay-fee]{:#term-minimum-fee}{:.term} (currently 1,000 satoshis) has been required to
broadcast a transaction across the network. Any transaction paying only the minimum fee
should be prepared to wait a long time before there's enough spare space
in a block to include it. Please see the [verifying payment section][section verifying payment]
for why this could be important.

Since each transaction spends Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) and
because a UTXO can only be spent once, the full value of the included
UTXOs must be spent or given to a miner as a transaction fee.  Few
people will have UTXOs that exactly match the amount they want to pay,
so most transactions include a change output.

[Change outputs][/en/glossary/change-address]{:#term-change-output}{:.term} are regular outputs which spend the surplus satoshis
from the UTXOs back to the spender.  They can reuse the same P2PKH pubkey hash
or P2SH script hash as was used in the UTXO, but for the reasons
described in the [next subsection](#avoiding-key-reuse), it is highly recommended that change
outputs be sent to a new P2PKH or P2SH address.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Avoiding Key Reuse
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

In a transaction, the spender and receiver each reveal to each other all
public keys or addresses used in the transaction. This allows either
person to use the public block chain to track past and future
transactions involving the other person's same public keys or addresses.

If the same public key is reused often, as happens when people use
Bitcoin addresses (hashed public keys) as static payment addresses,
other people can easily track the receiving and spending habits of that
person, including how many satoshis they control in known addresses.

It doesn't have to be that way. If each public key is used exactly
twice---once to receive a payment and once to spend that payment---the
user can gain a significant amount of financial privacy.

Even better, using new public keys or [unique
addresses][]{:#term-unique-address}{:.term} when accepting payments or creating
change outputs can be combined with other techniques discussed later,
such as CoinJoin or merge avoidance, to make it extremely difficult to
use the block chain by itself to reliably track how users receive and
spend their satoshis.

Avoiding key reuse can also provide security against attacks which might
allow reconstruction of private keys from public keys (hypothesized) or
from signature comparisons (possible today under certain circumstances
described below, with more general attacks hypothesized).

1. Unique (non-reused) P2PKH and P2SH addresses protect against the first
   type of attack by keeping ECDSA public keys hidden (hashed) until the
   first time satoshis sent to those addresses are spent, so attacks
   are effectively useless unless they can reconstruct private keys in
   less than the hour or two it takes for a transaction to be well
   protected by the block chain.

2. Unique (non-reused) private keys protect against the second type of
   attack by only generating one signature per private key, so attackers
   never get a subsequent signature to use in comparison-based attacks.
   Existing comparison-based attacks are only practical today when
   insufficient entropy is used in signing or when the entropy used
   is exposed by some means, such as a
   [side-channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack).

So, for both privacy and security, we encourage you to build your
applications to avoid public key reuse and, when possible, to discourage
users from reusing addresses. If your application needs to provide a
fixed URI to which payments should be sent, please see the
[`bitcoin:` URI section][bitcoin URI subsection] below.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Transaction Malleability
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

None of Bitcoin's signature hash types protect the signature script, leaving
the door open for a limited denial of service attack called [transaction
malleability][/en/glossary/malleability]{:.term}{:#term-transaction-malleability}. The signature script
contains the secp256k1 signature, which can't sign itself, allowing attackers to
make non-functional modifications to a transaction without rendering it
invalid. For example, an attacker can add some data to the signature script
which will be dropped before the previous pubkey script is processed.

Although the modifications are non-functional---so they do not change
what inputs the transaction uses nor what outputs it pays---they do
change the computed hash of the transaction. Since each transaction
links to previous transactions using hashes as a transaction
identifier (txid), a modified transaction will not have the txid its
creator expected.

This isn't a problem for most Bitcoin transactions which are designed to
be added to the block chain immediately. But it does become a problem
when the output from a transaction is spent before that transaction is
added to the block chain.

Bitcoin developers have been working to reduce transaction malleability
among standard transaction types, one outcome of those efforts is
[BIP 141: Segregated Witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki),
which is supported by Bitcoin Core but not activated. At present, new
transactions should not depend on
previous transactions which have not been added to the block chain yet,
especially if large amounts of satoshis are at stake.

Transaction malleability also affects payment tracking.  Bitcoin Core's
RPC interface lets you track transactions by their txid---but if that
txid changes because the transaction was modified, it may appear that
the transaction has disappeared from the network.

Current best practices for transaction tracking dictate that a
transaction should be tracked by the transaction outputs (UTXOs) it
spends as inputs, as they cannot be changed without invalidating the
transaction.

<!-- TODO/harding: The paragraph above needs practical advice about how
to do that. I'll need to find some time to look at somebody's wallet
code. -harding -->

Best practices further dictate that if a transaction does seem to
disappear from the network and needs to be reissued, that it be reissued
in a way that invalidates the lost transaction. One method which will
always work is to ensure the reissued payment spends all of the same
outputs that the lost transaction used as inputs.
