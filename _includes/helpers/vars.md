* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* Set to one of the following values:<br>• `send` if sending payment<br>• `receive` if this wallet received payment in a regular transaction<br>• `generate` if a matured and spendable coinbase<br>• `immature` if a coinbase that is not spendable yet<br>• `orphan` if a coinbase from a block that's not in the local best block chain

* {{DEPTH}}<br>`amount`

{% capture INCLUDE_SPEND_CONFIRMATIONS %}
{{json_table}}

* Confirmations
* number (int)
* Optional (0 or 1)
* The minimum number of confirmations an incoming transaction must have for its outputs to be credited to this account's balance. Outgoing transactions are always counted, as are move transactions made with the `move` RPC. If an account doesn't have a balance high enough to pay for this transaction, the payment will be rejected.  Use `0` to spend unconfirmed incoming payments. Default is `1`

![Warning icon](/img/icons/icon_warning.svg)
**Warning:** if account1 receives an unconfirmed payment and transfers
it to account2 with the `move` RPC, account2 will be able to spend those
bitcoins even if this parameter is set to `1` or higher.
