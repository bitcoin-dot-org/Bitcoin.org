The P2P `ping` message is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping." %}
{% assign summary_prioritiseTransaction="adds virtual priority or fee to a transaction, allowing it to be accepted into blocks mined by this node (or miners which use this node) with a lower priority or fee.

{% assign summary_restGetBlock-noTxDetails="gets a block with a particular header hash from the local block database either as a JSON object or as a serialized block.

{% assign summary_restGetTx="gets a hex-encoded serialized transaction or a JSON object describing the transaction.
