## P2P Network
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

The Bitcoin network protocol allows full nodes
([peers][peer]{:#term-peer}{:.term}) to collaboratively maintain a
[peer-to-peer network][network]{:#term-network}{:.term} for block and
transaction exchange. Many SPV clients also use this protocol to connect
to full nodes.

Consensus rules do not cover networking, so Bitcoin programs may use
alternative networks and protocols, such as the [high-speed block relay
network][] used by some miners and the [dedicated transaction
information servers][electrum server] used by some wallets that provide
SPV-level security.

To provide practical examples of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, this
section uses Bitcoin Core as a representative full node and [BitcoinJ][]
as a representative SPV client. Both programs are flexible, so only
default behavior is described. Also, for privacy, actual IP addresses
in the example output below have been replaced with [RFC5737][] reserved
IP addresses.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Peer Discovery
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

When started for the first time, programs don't know the IP
addresses of any active full nodes. In order to discover some IP
addresses, they query one or more DNS names (called [DNS seeds][/en/glossary/dns-seed]{:#term-dns-seed}{:.term})
hardcoded into Bitcoin Core and
BitcoinJ. The response to the lookup should include one or more [DNS
A records][] with the IP addresses of full nodes that may accept new
incoming connections. For example, using the [Unix `dig`
command][dig command]:

    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.	    IN  A

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.	60  IN  A  192.0.2.113
    seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.	60  IN  A  198.51.100.231
    seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.	60  IN  A  203.0.113.183
    [...]

The DNS seeds are maintained by Bitcoin community members: some of them
provide dynamic DNS seed servers which automatically get IP addresses
of active nodes by scanning the network; others provide static DNS
seeds that are updated manually and are more likely to provide IP
addresses for inactive nodes. In either case, nodes are added to the
DNS seed if they run on the default Bitcoin ports of 8333 for mainnet
or 18333 for testnet.

<!-- paragraph below based on Greg Maxwell's email in
     http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.devel/5378 -->

DNS seed results are not authenticated and a malicious seed operator or
network man-in-the-middle attacker can return only IP addresses of
nodes controlled by the attacker, isolating a program on the attacker's
own network and allowing the attacker to feed it bogus transactions and
blocks.  For this reason, programs should not rely on DNS seeds
exclusively.

Once a program has connected to the network, its peers can begin to send
it `addr`
(address<!--noref-->) messages with the IP addresses and port numbers of
other peers on the network, providing a fully decentralized method of
peer discovery. Bitcoin Core keeps a record of known peers in a
persistent on-disk database which usually allows it to connect directly
to those peers on subsequent startups without having to use DNS seeds.

However, peers often leave the network or change IP addresses, so
programs may need to make several different connection attempts at
startup before a successful connection is made. This can add a
significant delay to the amount of time it takes to connect to the
network, forcing a user to wait before sending a transaction or checking
the status of payment.

<!-- reference for "Bitcoin Core...11 seconds" below:
     https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4559 -->

To avoid this possible delay, BitcoinJ always uses dynamic DNS seeds to
get IP addresses for nodes believed to be currently active.
Bitcoin Core also tries to strike a balance between minimizing delays
and avoiding unnecessary DNS seed use: if Bitcoin Core has entries in
its peer database, it spends up to 11 seconds attempting to connect to
at least one of them before falling back to seeds; if a connection is
made within that time, it does not query any seeds.

<!-- reference for Bitcoin Core behavior described below: search for
"FixedSeeds" in src/net.cpp; BitcoinJ has IPv4 seeds in its chainparams
and a function to use them, but I don't see that function being used in
any of the examples/wallet templates (but I'm not Java fluent, so
maybe PEBKAC). -@harding -->

Both Bitcoin Core and BitcoinJ also include a hardcoded list of IP
addresses and port numbers to several dozen nodes which were active
around the time that particular version of the software was first
released. Bitcoin Core will start attempting to connect to these nodes
if none of the DNS seed servers have responded to a query within 60
seconds, providing an automatic fallback option.

As a manual fallback option, Bitcoin Core also provides several
command-line connection options, including the ability to get a list of
peers from a specific node by IP address, or to make a persistent
connection to a specific node by IP address.  See the `-help` text for
details.  BitcoinJ can be programmed to do the same thing.

**Resources:** [Bitcoin Seeder][], the program run by several of the
seeds used by Bitcoin Core and BitcoinJ. The Bitcoin Core [DNS Seed
Policy][].  The hardcoded list of IP addresses used by Bitcoin Core and
BitcoinJ is generated using the [makeseeds script][].

{% endautocrossref %}

### Connecting To Peers
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Connecting to a peer is done by sending a `version` message, which
contains your version number, block, and current time to the remote
node. The remote node responds with its own `version` message. Then both
nodes send a `verack` message to the other node to indicate the
connection has been established.

Once connected, the client can send to the remote node `getaddr` and `addr` messages to gather additional peers.

In order to maintain a connection with a peer, nodes by default will send a message to peers before 30 minutes of inactivity. If 90 minutes pass without a message being received by a peer, the client will assume that connection has closed.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Initial Block Download
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Before a full node can validate unconfirmed transactions and
recently-mined blocks, it must download and validate all blocks from
block 1 (the block after the hardcoded genesis block) to the current tip
of the best block chain. This is the Initial Block Download (IBD) or
initial sync.

Although the word "initial" implies this method is only used once, it
can also be used any time a large number of blocks need to be
downloaded, such as when a previously-caught-up node has been offline
for a long time. In this case, a node can use the IBD method to download
all the blocks which were produced since the last time it was online.

Bitcoin Core uses the IBD method any time the last block on its local
best block chain has a block header time more than 24 hours in the past.
Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 will also perform IBD if its local best block chain is
more than 144 blocks lower than its local best header chain (that is,
the local block chain is more than about 24 hours in the past).

{% endautocrossref %}

#### Blocks-First
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Bitcoin Core (up until version [0.9.3][bitcoin core 0.9.3]) uses a
simple initial block download (IBD) method we'll call *blocks-first*.
The goal is to download the blocks from the best block chain in sequence.

![Overview Of Blocks-First Method](/img/dev/en-blocks-first-flowchart.svg)

The first time a node is started, it only has a single block in its
local best block chain---the hardcoded genesis block (block 0).  This
node chooses a remote peer, called the sync node, and sends it the
`getblocks` message illustrated below.

![First GetBlocks Message Sent During IBD](/img/dev/en-ibd-getblocks.svg)

In the header hashes field of the `getblocks` message, this new node
sends the header hash of the only block it has, the genesis block
(6fe2...0000 in internal byte order).  It also sets the stop hash field
to all zeroes to request a maximum-size response.

Upon receipt of the `getblocks` message, the sync node takes the first
(and only) header hash and searches its local best block chain for a
block with that header hash. It finds that block 0 matches, so it
replies with 500 block inventories (the maximum response to a
`getblocks` message) starting from block 1. It sends these inventories
in the `inv` message illustrated below.

![First Inv Message Sent During IBD](/img/dev/en-ibd-inv.svg)

Inventories are unique identifiers for information on the network. Each
inventory contains a type field and the unique identifier for an
instance of the object. For blocks, the unique identifier is a hash of
the block's header.

The block inventories appear in the `inv` message in the same order they
appear in the block chain, so this first `inv` message contains
inventories for blocks 1 through 501. (For example, the hash of block 1
is 4860...0000 as seen in the illustration above.)

The IBD node uses the received inventories to request 128 blocks from
the sync node in the `getdata` message illustrated below.

![First GetData Message Sent During IBD](/img/dev/en-ibd-getdata.svg)

It's important to blocks-first nodes that the blocks be requested and
sent in order because each block header references the header hash of
the preceding block. That means the IBD node can't fully validate a
block until its parent block has been received. Blocks that can't be
validated because their parents haven't been received are called orphan
blocks; a subsection below describes them in more detail.

Upon receipt of the `getdata` message, the sync node replies with each
of the blocks requested. Each block is put into serialized block format
and sent in a separate `block` message. The first `block` message sent
(for block 1) is illustrated below.

![First Block Message Sent During IBD](/img/dev/en-ibd-block.svg)

The IBD node downloads each block, validates it, and then requests the
next block it hasn't requested yet, maintaining a queue of up to 128
blocks to download. When it has requested every block for which it has
an inventory, it sends another `getblocks` message to the sync node
requesting the inventories of up to 500 more blocks.  This second
`getblocks` message contains multiple header hashes as illustrated
below:

![Second GetBlocks Message Sent During IBD](/img/dev/en-ibd-getblocks2.svg)

Upon receipt of the second `getblocks` message, the sync node searches
its local best block chain for a block that matches one of the header
hashes in the message, trying each hash in the order they were received.
If it finds a matching hash, it replies with 500 block inventories
starting with the next block from that point. But if there is no
matching hash (besides the stopping hash), it assumes the only block the
two nodes have in common is block 0 and so it sends an `inv` starting with
block 1 (the same `inv` message seen several illustrations above).

This repeated search allows the sync node to send useful inventories even if
the IBD node's local block chain forked from the sync node's local block
chain. This fork detection becomes increasingly useful the closer the
IBD node gets to the tip of the block chain.

When the IBD node receives the second `inv` message, it will request
those blocks using `getdata` messages.  The sync node will respond with
`block` messages.  Then the IBD node will request more inventories with
another `getblocks` message---and the cycle will repeat until the IBD
node is synced to the tip of the block chain.  At that point, the node
will accept blocks sent through the regular block broadcasting described
in a later subsection.

{% endautocrossref %}

##### Blocks-First Advantages & Disadvantages
{:.no_toc}
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

The primary advantage of blocks-first IBD is its simplicity. The primary
disadvantage is that the IBD node relies on a single sync node for all
of its downloading. This has several implications:

* **Speed Limits:** All requests are made to the sync node, so if the
  sync node has limited upload bandwidth, the IBD node will have slow
  download speeds.  Note: if the sync node goes offline, Bitcoin Core
  will continue downloading from another node---but it will still only
  download from a single sync node at a time.

* **Download Restarts:** The sync node can send a non-best (but
  otherwise valid) block chain to the IBD node. The IBD node won't be
  able to identify it as non-best until the initial block download nears
  completion, forcing the IBD node to restart its block chain download
  over again from a different node. Bitcoin Core ships with several
  block chain checkpoints at various block heights selected by
  developers to help an IBD node detect that it is being fed an
  alternative block chain history---allowing the IBD node to restart
  its download earlier in the process.

* **Disk Fill Attacks:** Closely related to the download restarts, if
  the sync node sends a non-best (but otherwise valid) block chain, the
  chain will be stored on disk, wasting space and possibly filling up
  the disk drive with useless data.

* **High Memory Use:** Whether maliciously or by accident, the sync node
  can send blocks out of order, creating orphan blocks which can't be
  validated until their parents have been received and validated.
  Orphan blocks are stored in memory while they await validation,
  which may lead to high memory use.

All of these problems are addressed in part or in full by the
headers-first IBD method used in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0.

**Resources:** The table below summarizes the messages mentioned
throughout this subsection. The links in the message field will take you
to the reference page for that message.

| **Message** | [`getblocks`][getblocks message] | [`inv`][inv message]                             | [`getdata`][getdata message]  | [`block`][block message]
| **From→To** | IBD→Sync                         | Sync→IBD                                         | IBD→Sync                      | Sync→IBD
| **Payload** | One or more header hashes        | Up to 500 block inventories (unique identifiers) | One or more block inventories | One serialized block

{% endautocrossref %}

#### Headers-First
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 uses an initial block download (IBD) method called
*headers-first*. The goal is to download the headers for the best [header
chain][/en/glossary/header-chain]{:#term-header-chain}{:.term}, partially validate them as best
as possible, and then download the corresponding blocks in parallel.  This
solves several problems with the older blocks-first IBD method.

![Overview Of Headers-First Method](/img/dev/en-headers-first-flowchart.svg)

The first time a node is started, it only has a single block in its
local best block chain---the hardcoded genesis block (block 0).  The
node chooses a remote peer, which we'll call the sync node, and sends it the
`getheaders` message illustrated below.

![First getheaders message](/img/dev/en-ibd-getheaders.svg)

In the header hashes field of the `getheaders` message, the new node
sends the header hash of the only block it has, the genesis block
(6fe2...0000 in internal byte order).  It also sets the stop hash field
to all zeroes to request a maximum-size response.

Upon receipt of the `getheaders` message, the sync node takes the first
(and only) header hash and searches its local best block chain for a
block with that header hash. It finds that block 0 matches, so it
replies with 2,000 header (the maximum response) starting from
block 1. It sends these header hashes in the `headers` message
illustrated below.

![First headers message](/img/dev/en-ibd-headers.svg)

The IBD node can partially validate these block headers by ensuring that
all fields follow consensus rules and that the hash of the header is
below the target threshold according to the nBits field.  (Full
validation still requires all transactions from the corresponding
block.)

After the IBD node has partially validated the block headers, it can do
two things in parallel:

1. **Download More Headers:** the IBD node can send another `getheaders`
   message to the sync node to request the next 2,000 headers on the
   best header chain. Those headers can be immediately validated and
   another batch requested repeatedly until a `headers` message is
   received from the sync node with fewer than 2,000 headers, indicating
   that it has no more headers to offer. As of this writing, headers
   sync can be completed in fewer than 200 round trips, or about 32 MB
   of downloaded data.

    Once the IBD node receives a `headers` message with fewer than 2,000
    headers from the sync node, it sends a `getheaders` message to each
    of its outbound peers to get their view of best header chain. By
    comparing the responses, it can easily determine if the headers it
    has downloaded belong to the best header chain reported by any of
    its outbound peers. This means a dishonest sync node will quickly be
    discovered even if checkpoints aren't used (as long as the IBD node
    connects to at least one honest peer; Bitcoin Core will continue to
    provide checkpoints in case honest peers can't be found).

2. **Download Blocks:** While the IBD node continues downloading
   headers, and after the headers finish downloading, the IBD node will
   request and download each block. The IBD node can use the block
   header hashes it computed from the header chain to create `getdata`
   messages that request the blocks it needs by their inventory. It
   doesn't need to request these from the sync node---it can request
   them from any of its full node peers. (Although not all full nodes
   may store all blocks.) This allows it to fetch blocks in parallel and
   avoid having its download speed constrained to the upload speed of a
   single sync node.

    To spread the load between multiple peers, Bitcoin Core will only
    request up to 16 blocks at a time from a single peer. Combined with
    its maximum of 8 outbound connections, this means headers-first
    Bitcoin Core will request a maximum of 128 blocks simultaneously
    during IBD (the same maximum number that blocks-first Bitcoin Core
    requested from its sync node).

![Simulated Headers-First Download Window](/img/dev/en-headers-first-moving-window.svg)

Bitcoin Core's headers-first mode uses a 1,024-block moving download
window to maximize download speed. The lowest-height block in the window
is the next block to be validated; if the block hasn't arrived by the
time Bitcoin Core is ready to validate it, Bitcoin Core will wait a
minimum of two more seconds for the stalling node to send the block. If
the block still hasn't arrived, Bitcoin Core will disconnect from the
stalling node and attempt to connect to another node. For example, in
the illustration above, Node A will be disconnected if it doesn't send
block 3 within at least two seconds.

Once the IBD node is synced to the tip of the block chain, it will
accept blocks sent through the regular block broadcasting described in a
later subsection.

**Resources:** The table below summarizes the messages mentioned
throughout this subsection. The links in the message field will take you
to the reference page for that message.

| **Message** | [`getheaders`][getheaders message] | [`headers`][headers message] | [`getdata`][getdata message]                             | [`block`][block message]

{% endautocrossref %}

### Block Broadcasting
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

When a miner discovers a new block, it broadcasts the new block to its
peers using one of the following methods:

* **[Unsolicited Block Push][]{:#term-unsolicited-block-push}{:.term}:**
  the miner sends a `block` message to each of its full node peers with
  the new block. The miner can reasonably bypass the standard relay
  method in this way because it knows none of its peers already have the
  just-discovered block.

* **[Standard Block Relay][]{:#term-standard-block-relay}{:.term}:**
  the miner, acting as a standard relay node, sends an `inv` message to
  each of its peers (both full node and SPV) with an inventory referring
  to the new block. The most common responses are:

   * Each blocks-first (BF) peer that wants the block replies with a
     `getdata` message requesting the full block.

   * Each headers-first (HF) peer that wants the block replies with a
     `getheaders` message containing the header hash of the
     highest-height header on its best header chain, and likely also
     some headers further back on the best header chain to allow fork
     detection. That message is immediately followed by a `getdata`
     message requesting the full block. By requesting headers first, a
     headers-first peer can refuse orphan blocks as described in the
     subsection below.

   * Each Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) client that wants the
     block replies with a `getdata` message typically requesting a
     merkle block.

   The miner replies to each request accordingly by sending the block
   in a `block` message, one or more headers in a `headers` message,
   or the merkle block and transactions relative to the SPV client's
   bloom filter in a `merkleblock` message followed by zero or more
   `tx` messages.

By default, Bitcoin Core broadcasts blocks using standard block relay,
but it will accept blocks sent using either of the methods described above.

Full nodes validate the received block and then advertise it to their
peers using the standard block relay method described above.  The condensed
table below highlights the operation of the messages described above
(Relay, BF, HF, and SPV refer to the relay node, a blocks-first node, a
headers-first node, and an SPV client; *any* refers to a node using any
block retrieval method.)

| **Message** | [`inv`][inv message]                                   | [`getdata`][getdata message]               | [`getheaders`][getheaders message]                                     | [`headers`][headers message]
| **From→To** | Relay→*Any*                                            | BF→Relay                                   | HF→Relay                                                               | Relay→HF

| **Payload** | The new block in [serialized format][section serialized blocks] | The new block filtered into a merkle block | Serialized transactions from the new block that match the bloom filter |

{% endautocrossref %}

#### Orphan Blocks
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Blocks-first nodes may download orphan blocks---blocks whose previous
block header hash field refers to a block header this node
hasn't seen yet. In other words, orphan blocks have no known parent
(unlike stale blocks, which have known parents but which aren't part of
the best block chain).

![Difference Between Orphan And Stale Blocks](/img/dev/en-orphan-stale-definition.svg)

When a blocks-first node downloads an orphan block, it will not validate
it. Instead, it will send a `getblocks` message to the node which sent
the orphan block; the broadcasting node will respond with an `inv` message
containing inventories of any blocks the downloading node is missing (up
to 500); the downloading node will request those blocks with a `getdata`
message; and the broadcasting node will send those blocks with a `block`
message. The downloading node will validate those blocks, and once the
parent of the former orphan block has been validated, it will validate
the former orphan block.

Headers-first nodes avoid some of this complexity by always requesting
block headers with the `getheaders` message before requesting a block
with the `getdata` message. The broadcasting node will send a `headers`
message containing all the block headers (up to 2,000) it thinks the
downloading node needs to reach the tip of the best header chain; each of
those headers will point to its parent, so when the downloading node
receives the `block` message, the block shouldn't be an orphan
block---all of its parents should be known (even if they haven't been
validated yet). If, despite this, the block received in the `block`
message is an orphan block, a headers-first node will discard it immediately.

However, orphan discarding does mean that headers-first nodes will
ignore orphan blocks sent by miners in an unsolicited block push.

{% endautocrossref %}

### Transaction Broadcasting
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

In order to send a transaction to a peer, an `inv` message is sent. If a `getdata` response message is received, the transaction is sent using `tx`. The peer receiving this transaction also forwards the transaction in the same manner, given that it is a valid transaction.

{% endautocrossref %}

#### Memory Pool
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Full peers may keep track of unconfirmed transactions which are eligible to
be included in the next block. This is essential for miners who will
actually mine some or all of those transactions, but it's also useful
for any peer who wants to keep track of unconfirmed transactions, such
as peers serving unconfirmed transaction information to SPV clients.

Because unconfirmed transactions have no permanent status in Bitcoin,
Bitcoin Core stores them in non-persistent memory, calling them a memory
pool or mempool. When a peer shuts down, its memory pool is lost except
for any transactions stored by its wallet. This means that never-mined
unconfirmed transactions tend to slowly disappear from the network as
peers restart or as they purge some transactions to make room in memory
for others.

Transactions which are mined into blocks that later become stale blocks may be
added back into the memory pool. These re-added transactions may be
re-removed from the pool almost immediately if the replacement blocks
include them. This is the case in Bitcoin Core, which removes stale
blocks from the chain one by one, starting with the tip (highest block).
As each block is removed, its transactions are added back to the memory
pool. After all of the stale blocks are removed, the replacement
blocks are added to the chain one by one, ending with the new tip. As
each block is added, any transactions it confirms are removed from the
memory pool.

SPV clients don't have a memory pool for the same reason they don't
relay transactions. They can't independently verify that a transaction
hasn't yet been included in a block and that it only spends UTXOs, so
they can't know which transactions are eligible to be included in the
next block.

{% endautocrossref %}




### Misbehaving Nodes
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Take note that for both types of broadcasting, mechanisms are in place to punish misbehaving peers who take up bandwidth and computing resources by sending false information. If a peer gets a banscore above the `-banscore=<n>` threshold, he will be banned for the number of seconds defined by `-bantime=<n>`, which is 86,400 by default (24 hours).

{% endautocrossref %}

### Alerts
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

In case of a bug or attack,
the Bitcoin Core developers provide a
[Bitcoin alert service](https://bitcoin.org/en/alerts) with an RSS feed
and users of Bitcoin Core can check the error field of the `getinfo` RPC
results to get currently active alerts for their specific version of
Bitcoin Core.

These messages are aggressively broadcast using the `alert` message, being sent to each peer upon connect for the duration of the alert.
