*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.9.2.*

The `getnetworkinfo` RPC {{summary_getNetworkInfo}}

*Parameters: none*

*Result---information about the node's connection to the network*

{{json_table}}

* `result`
* object
* Required (exactly 1)
* Information about this node's connection to the network

* →<br>`version`
* number
* Required (exactly 1)
* This node's version of Bitcoin Core in its internal integer format.  For example, Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 has the integer version number 90200

* →<br>`subversion`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>The user agent this node sends in its `version` message

* →<br>`protocolversion`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The protocol version number used by this node.  See the [protocol versions section][section protocol versions] for more information

* →<br>`timeoffset`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The offset of the node's clock from the computer's clock (both in UTC) in seconds.  The offset may be up to 4200 seconds (70 minutes)

* →<br>`connections`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The total number of open connections (both outgoing and incoming) between this node and other nodes

* →<br>`proxy`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* The hostname/IP address and port number of the proxy, if set, or an empty string if unset

* →<br>`relayfee`
* number (bitcoins)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The minimum fee a low-priority transaction must pay in order for this node to accept it into its memory pool

* →<br>`localservices`
* string (hex)
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>The services supported by this node as advertised in its `version` message

* →<br>`networks`
* array
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>An array with three objects: one describing the IPv4 connection, one describing the IPv6 connection, and one describing the Tor hidden service (onion) connection

* → →<br>Network
* object
* Optional (0 to 3)
* An object describing a network.  If the network is unroutable, it will not be returned

* → → →<br>`name`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* The name of the network.  Either `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or `onion`

* → → →<br>`limited`
* bool
* Required (exactly 1)
* Set to `true` if only connections to this network are allowed according to the `-onlynet` Bitcoin Core command-line/configuration-file parameter.  Otherwise set to `false`

* → → →<br>`reachable`
* bool
* Required (exactly 1)
* Set to `true` if connections can be made to or from this network.  Otherwise set to `false`

* → → →<br>`proxy`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* The hostname and port of any proxy being used for this network.  If a proxy is not in use, an empty string

* → → →<br>`localaddresses`
* array
* Required (exactly 1)
* An array of objects each describing the local addresses this node believes it listens on

* → → → →<br>Address
* object
* Optional (0 or more)
* An object describing a particular address this node believes it listens on

* → → → → →<br>`address`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* An IP address or .onion address this node believes it listens on.  This may be manually configured, auto detected, or based on `version` messages this node received from its peers

* → → → → →<br>`port`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The port number this node believes it listens on for the associated `address`.  This may be manually configured, auto detected, or based on `version` messages this node received from its peers

* → → → → →<br>`score`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The self-assigned score this node gives to this connection; higher scores means the node thinks this connection is better <!-- SOMEDAY: figure out scores -->

*Example from Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*
