The `getpeerinfo` RPC {{summary_getPeerInfo}}

*Parameters: none*

*Result---information about each currently-connected network node*

{{json_table}}

* `result`
* array
* Required (exactly 1)
* An array of objects each describing one connected node.  If there are no connections, the array will be empty

* →<br>Node
* object
* Optional (0 or more)
* An object describing a particular connected node

* → →<br>`id`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>The node's index number in the local node address database

* → →<br>`addr`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* The IP address and port number used for the connection to the remote node

* → →<br>`addrlocal`
* string
* Optional (0 or 1)
* Our IP address and port number according to the remote node.  May be incorrect due to error or lying.  Many SPV nodes set this to `127.0.0.1:8333`

* → →<br>`services`
* string (hex)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The services advertised by the remote node in its `version` message

* → →<br>`lastsend`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The Unix epoch time when we last successfully sent data to the TCP socket for this node

* → →<br>`lastrecv`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The Unix epoch time when we last received data from this node

* → →<br>`bytessent`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The total number of bytes we've sent to this node

* → →<br>`bytesrecv`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The total number of bytes we've received from this node

* → →<br>`conntime`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The Unix epoch time when we connected to this node

* → →<br>`pingtime`
* number (real)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The number of seconds this node took to respond to our last P2P `ping` message

* → →<br>`pingwait`
* number (real)
* Optional (0 or 1)
* The number of seconds we've been waiting for this node to respond to a P2P `ping` message.  Only shown if there's an outstanding `ping` message

* → →<br>`version`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The protocol version number used by this node.  See the [protocol versions section][section protocol versions] for more information

* → →<br>`subver`
* string
* Required (exactly 1)
* The user agent this node sends in its `version` message.  This string will have been sanitized to prevent corrupting the JSON results.  May be an empty string

* → →<br>`inbound`
* bool
* Required (exactly 1)
* Set to `true` if this node connected to us; set to `false` if we connected to this node

* → →<br>`startingheight`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The height of the remote node's block chain when it connected to us as reported in its `version` message

* → →<br>`banscore`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* The ban score we've assigned the node based on any misbehavior it's made.  By default, Bitcoin Core disconnects when the ban score reaches `100`

* → →<br>`synced_headers`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>The highest-height header we have in common with this node based the last P2P `headers` message it sent us.  If a `headers` message has not been received, this will be set to `-1`

* → →<br>`synced_blocks`
* number (int)
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>The highest-height block we have in common with this node based on P2P `inv` messages this node sent us.  If no block `inv` messages have been received from this node, this will be set to `-1`

* → →<br>`syncnode`
* bool
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Removed in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>Whether we're using this node as our syncnode during initial block download

* → →<br>`inflight`
* array
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>An array of blocks which have been requested from this peer.  May be empty

* → → →<br>Blocks
* number (int)
* Optional (0 or more)
* The height of a block being requested from the remote peer

* → →<br>`whitelisted`
* bool
* Required (exactly 1)
* *Added in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*<br><br>Set to `true` if the remote peer has been whitelisted; otherwise, set to `false`.  Whitelisted peers will not be banned if their ban score exceeds the maximum (100 by default).  By default, peers connecting from localhost are whitelisted

*Example from Bitcoin Core 0.10.0*
