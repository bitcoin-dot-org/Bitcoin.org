### HTTP REST
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

As of [version 0.10.0][bitcoin core 0.10.0], Bitcoin Core provides
an **unauthenticated** HTTP REST interface.  The interface runs on the
same port as the JSON-RPC interface, by default port 8332 for mainnet and
port 18332 for testnet. It must be enabled by either starting Bitcoin
Core with the `-rest` option or by specifying `rest=1` in the
configuration file.

The interface is not intended for public access and is only accessible
from localhost by default.

{{WARNING}} A web browser can access a HTTP REST interface running on
localhost, possibly allowing third parties to use cross-site scripting
attacks to download your transaction and block data, reducing your
privacy.  If you have privacy concerns, you should not run a browser on
the same computer as a REST-enabled Bicoin Core node.

The interface uses standard [HTTP status
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and
returns a plain-text description of errors for debugging.
