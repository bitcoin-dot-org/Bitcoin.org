For Ubuntu users, there is a new ppa maintained by Matt Corallo which
you can add to your system so that it will automatically keep
bitcoin up-to-date.  Just type

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
 
in your terminal, then install the bitcoin-qt package.

BUG FIXES
---------

* Re-enable SSL support for the JSON-RPC interface (it was unintentionally
disabled for the 0.5.0 release binaries).

* The code that finds peers via "dns seeds" no longer stops bitcoin startup
if one of the dns seed machines is down.

* Tooltips on the transaction list view were rendering incorrectly (as black boxes
or with a transparent background).

* Prevent a denial-of-service attack involving flooding a bitcoin node with
orphan blocks.

* The wallet passphrase dialog now warns you if the caps lock key was pressed.

* Improved searching in addresses and labels in bitcoin-qt.
