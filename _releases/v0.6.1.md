title: Bitcoin-Qt version 0.6.1 released
---
Bitcoin-Qt version 0.6.1 is now available for download at:
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.6.1/>

This is a bug-fix and code-cleanup release, with no major new features.

NOTABLE CHANGES
===============

Much faster shutdowns. However, the blkindex.dat file is no longer
portable to different data directories by default. If you need a
portable blkindex.dat file then run with the new -detachdb=1 option
or the "Detach databases at shutdown" GUI preference.

Mac and Windows binaries are compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.1b (Linux
binaries are dynamically linked to the version of OpenSSL on the system).
