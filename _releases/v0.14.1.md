Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

RPC changes
-----------

- The first positional argument of `createrawtransaction` was renamed from
  `transactions` to `inputs`.

- The argument of `disconnectnode` was renamed from `node` to `address`.

These interface changes break compatibility with 0.14.0, when the named
arguments functionality, introduced in 0.14.0, is used. Client software
using these calls with named arguments needs to be updated.

Mining
------

In previous versions, getblocktemplate required segwit support from downstream
clients/miners once the feature activated on the network. In this version, it
now supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit
transactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to
continue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.

Due to the limitations in previous versions, getblocktemplate also recommended
non-segwit clients to not signal for the segwit version-bit. Since this is no
longer an issue, getblocktemplate now always recommends signalling segwit for
all miners. This is safe because ability to enforce the rule is the only
required criteria for safe activation, not actually producing segwit-enabled
blocks.

UTXO memory accounting
----------------------

Memory usage for the UTXO cache is being calculated more accurately, so that
the configured limit (`-dbcache`) will be respected when memory usage peaks
during cache flushes.  The memory accounting in prior releases is estimated to
only account for half the actual peak utilization.

The default `-dbcache` has also been changed in this release to 450MiB.  Users
who currently set `-dbcache` to a high value (e.g. to keep the UTXO more fully
cached in memory) should consider increasing this setting in order to achieve
the same cache performance as prior releases.  Users on low-memory systems
(such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for
this parameter.

Additional information relating to running on low-memory systems can be found
here:
[reducing-bitcoind-memory-usage.md](https://gist.github.com/laanwj/efe29c7661ce9b6620a7).
