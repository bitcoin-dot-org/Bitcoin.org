BUG FIXES
---------

* Check all transactions in blocks after the last checkpoint (0.5.0 and 0.5.1
skipped checking ECDSA signatures during initial blockchain download; this was
not a security vulnerability).

* Cease locking memory used by non-sensitive information (this caused a huge
performance hit on some platforms, especially noticable during initial blockchain
download).

* Fixed some address-handling deadlocks (client freezes).

* No longer accept inbound connections over the internet when Bitcoin is being
used with Tor (identity leak).

* Re-enable SSL support for the JSON-RPC interface (it was unintentionally
disabled for the 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 release Linux binaries).

* Use the correct base transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC for accepting transactions
into mined blocks (since 0.4.0, it was incorrectly accepting 0.0001 BTC which was
only meant to be relayed).

* Don't show "IP" for transactions which are not necessarily IP transactions.

* Add new DNS seeds (maintained by Pieter Wuille and Luke Dashjr).
