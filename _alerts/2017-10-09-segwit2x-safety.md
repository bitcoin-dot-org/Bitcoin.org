## Summary

A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay have signed an agreement to adopt
and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin [sometime](https://bashco.github.io/2x_Countdown/) in November. A hard fork is a
backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork is not supported by
the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and is therefore a contentious hard fork.
By adopting this hard fork, we believe the supporters of this agreement are shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.

The signatories of this agreement wrongly believe that the currency created by adopting
this contentious hard fork will eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore storing any BTC on services such
as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could
find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin.
The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to [download the latest version of Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)
and transfer out any BTC stored on services that are a signatory to this agreement. We have
listed the businesses supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.

For users who aren't prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend
a wallet such as [GreenAddress](https://greenaddress.it/), [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) or [TREZOR](https://trezor.io/). Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info.
However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after the hard fork. Any transactions you
make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and "replayed" on the altcoin chain. If the coins on the contentious
hard fork have any value, there will be methods you can use to "split" your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention
to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after the fork so you stay informed.

## Mobile wallets

Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively
creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions.
There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork. A majority of miners have pledged to support the contentious
hard fork, therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true block chain. As a
result of this, spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You will be
vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.

If the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge
to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets, however you should check multiple
sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, [/r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/), and the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org)
to make sure that it's safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions
during and shortly after the hard fork.

## After the fork

Blocks may be slower shortly after the hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You
will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed
in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before the hard fork [date](http://bashco.github.io/2x_Countdown/).
A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin
so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by this contentious hard fork, you should
exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. As the
hard fork has very little replay protection, most transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network will also
be valid on the hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.

Some services may continue to present and name the altcoin created by this contentious hard
fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only
be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals,
miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an
emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. This
hard fork being adopted by the signatories of this agreement achieves none of these things. It is a rushed
and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community.
As this new altcoin is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org will not list wallets and services that present
this altcoin as "Bitcoin" or "BTC" to their users after the hard fork. These services have exited
the Bitcoin system in a contentious manner and therefore are no longer useful to our visitors.

The following companies and services have pledged to adopt the contentious hard fork:
