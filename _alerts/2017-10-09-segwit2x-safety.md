## Summary

A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay signed an agreement to adopt
and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin [sometime](https://bashco.github.io/2x_Countdown/) in November. It has now been canceled. A hard fork is a
backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork was not supported by
the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and was therefore a contentious hard fork.
If this hard fork was adopted, we believe the supporters of this agreement would be shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.

The signatories of this agreement did believe that the currency created by adopting
this contentious hard fork could eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore, storing any BTC on services such
as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could
find that if the hard fork had happened, your BTC would have been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin
The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to [download the latest version of Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)
and transfer out any BTC stored on services that were a signatory to this agreement. We have
listed the businesses that had been supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.

For users who aren't prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend
a wallet such as [GreenAddress](https://greenaddress.it/), [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) or [TREZOR](https://trezor.io/). Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info.
However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after any hard fork. Any transactions you
make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and "replayed" on the any hard fork without "replay protection". If the coins on any contentious
hard fork have value, there will be methods you can use to "split" your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention
to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after any fork so you stay informed.

## Mobile wallets

Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively
creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions.
There was considerable mining power supporting the contentious Segwit2X hard fork. Spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You could be
vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.

Since the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge
to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets. However, you should check multiple
sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, [/r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/), and the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org)
to make sure that it's safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions
during and shortly after any hard fork.

## After the fork

Blocks may be slower shortly after a hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You
will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed
in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before a hard fork [date](http://bashco.github.io/2x_Countdown/).
A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin
so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by a contentious hard fork. You should
exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. Hard forks withouy replay protection allow transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network to be valid on a hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.

Some services may continue to present and name any altcoin created by a contentious hard
fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is likely not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only
be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals,
miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an
emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. A
hard fork being adopted by a select few achieves none of these things. Rushed
and hasty upgrades which only have minority community support that have been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community are not Bitcoin.
