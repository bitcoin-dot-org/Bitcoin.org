## Translation

### How to translate

* Translations can be done on transifex https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoinorg/
* You must be a native speaker for the language you choose to translate.
* At least one other reviewer is required.
* Changing the meaning of any statement should be avoided. In doubt, you can open a discussion on transifex.
* Sentences and popular expressions should be adapted so that they sound native in your language.

### Add new translations

1. Begin, Add language code where required in _config.yml.
2. Import, Download the translated .yml file from transifex and put that file in _translations.
3. Images, Translate the few images that contain text with a vector image editing software like Inkscape. Translations for these images are at the end of the imported .yml translation file. Make sure to convert all texts to paths when saving final svg files.
4. Vocabulary, Add correct alphabetical order for your language in the vocabulary page.
5. Preview, Check if all pages are complete, test each links, check that texts with a limited size display nicely. For example, right side buttons and some titles have height or width restrictions.

### Update translations

You can import all translations (complete and incomplete) from transifex using the transifex client:

    tx init
    tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoinorg/
    tx pull -a -s --skip
    
Then, you can overwrite any specific translation in the _translations folder by one of these files. You might also need to make sure that each .html files (in _layouts, _templates and _redirects) don't serve outdated content for those languages. You should also make sure that no urls or anchor has been changed by translators.

### Update source english strings

Any change in the english texts can be done through a pull request on github. If your changes affect the html layout of a page, you should apply fallback html code for other languages until they are updated.

    {% case page.lang %}
    {% when 'fr' %}
      (outdated french content)
    {% else %}
      (up to date english content)
    {% endcase %}
    
### Update source strings on transifex

**When translation is needed**: If you want all changes you've made to be re-translated, you can simply update the resource file (en.yml) on transifex.

**When translation is not needed**: If you are only pushing typo fixes and that you don't want translators to redo all their work again, you can use the transifex client to pull translations, update en.yml and push back all translations at once:

    tx init
    tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoinorg/
    tx pull -a -s --skip
    tx set --source -r bitcoinorg.bitcoinorg -l en translations/bitcoinorg.bitcoinorg/en.yml
    (update en.yml)
    tx push -s -t -f --skip --no-interactive

## Guidelines for press interviewees

The press center displays a list of featured interviewees who
demonstrate professional qualities when dealing with the press.
Interviewees are accepted based on the following guidelines:

1. **Guidelines** : Those guidelines are not hard rules and they aren't
meant to be followed blindly. Choosing interviewees is a matter of open
discussion and common sense.
2. **Experience** : Interviewees must have done professional and good
quality interviews or publications in the past.
3. **Background** : Interviewees must be known or involved in the
Bitcoin community or be involved in projects related to Bitcoin.
4. **Accuracy** : Interviewees must have a good understanding of Bitcoin
and provide accurate informations.
5. **Relevancy** : Interviewees must be able to provide understandable
answers that remain relevant to the questions.
5. **Opinion** : Interviewees must differentiate facts and opinions in
order to help journalists and their audience to understand Bitcoin and
build their own opinion. Speaking in a way that makes people think that
Bitcoin is exclusive to any school of thought does not honor the open
nature of Bitcoin.
6. **Felony** : Interviewees must not publicly encourage illegal
behaviors in any way.
7. **Diplomacy** : Interviewees must be able to maintain a diplomatic
language and stay away from provocative or subversive language as much
as possible. Interviewees role includes educating people and legislators
about Bitcoin properties, qualities and innovations. Lack of diplomacy
can go against this mission, create friction and interfere with other
diplomatic efforts.
