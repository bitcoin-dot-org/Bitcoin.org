## Translation

### Guidelines

* You must be a native speaker for the language you choose to translate.
* At least one other reviewer might be required and is highly recommanded.
* Try to avoid changing the meaning of any statements. If you need to change the meaning of anything, make a note of it and list that in the pull request.
* Sentences and popular expressions should be adapted so that they sound native in your language.
* You must save your work with UTF-8 encoding.

### How to translate

1. Begin, Run ./_contrib/translate (ISO 639-1 language code) (language name) to create your language. Ex : ./_contrib/translate fr "Français"
2. Texts, Open .html files in the appropriate folder and in _layouts and translate all human readable english dialogs (without touching the html tags and the page id).
3. Links, Update the name of each .html file so that it reflects your language. Add translated links to your pages in _config.yml.
4. Images, Update the few images that contain text with any vector image editing software like Inkscape.
5. Languages, Make sure that the languages are listed in alphabetical order in _config.yml
6. Post, Remove pages that use _posts such as "version-history" and "news". Those are not meant to be translated yet.
7. Press, Remove "press coverage" and "interviewees" in the Press center. The rest can be translated.
8. Preview, Check that texts that are limited in size display nicely. For example, right side buttons and some titles have height or width restrictions. You can preview your work without building the website. Just visit the existing english page, open the javascript console of your browser (CTRL + SHIFT + J on Google Chrome) and copy the following command to make the page editable : document.body.contentEditable=true . This will allow you to edit and preview the page in your browser like a document.

### Update

Each time that a commit needs to be translated in other languages, a link to this commit must be added to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/wiki/Translations-tracking with all current languages listed under it. When a translation is updated through a pull request, all occurences of this language can be removed from the translations tracking page.

## Advanced Usage

### Alerts

You can easily put an alert on the website by changing the ALERT and ALERT\_CLASS variables in _config.yml.  
You can both set one fallback alert for all languages and many translated alerts for specific languages.

Example:

```
ALERT_CLASS:
  all: <strong>Security alert:</strong> Please upgrade to 0.8.1 as soon as possible!
  fr: <strong>Alerte de sécurité:</strong> Mettez Bitcoin à jour vers la version 0.8.1 sans délais!
ALERT:
  all: error
  fr: error
```

This will produce an english red alert box for all languages, and a translated red alert box for french language.  
Possible classes are: **error** (red), **info** (blue), **success** (green) and **warning** (yellow)

### Release Notes

Release notes should be placed in `_posts/releases/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SHORTTITLE.md` and adhere to this format:

```
---
layout: post
title: Bitcoin version 0.3.24 released
src: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27771039
category: releases
---

Bitcoin v0.3.24 is now available for download at
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/>

...
```
* `SHORTTITLE` is used to construct the URL. Something like `v0.3.24` will be fine
* `layout: post` important for Jekyll
* `title: ...` will be used as the title
* `src: ...` (optional) link to full annoucement
* `category: ...` category of post
** `releases`
** `events`

### Aliases for contributors

Aliases for contributors are defined in ```_config.yml```.

```
aliases:
  s_nakamoto: Satoshi Nakamoto
  --author=Satoshi Nakamoto: Satoshi Nakamoto
  gavinandresen: Gavin Andresen
```
