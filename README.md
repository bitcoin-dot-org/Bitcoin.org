## Advanced Usage

### Alerts

You can easily put alerts on the homepage by changing the ALERT and ALERT\_CLASS variables in index.html.

Example:

```
ALERT_CLASS: error
ALERT: <strong>Security alert:</strong> Please upgrade to 0.3.25 as soon as possible!
```


will produce a red alert box. Possible classes are: error (red), info (blue), success (green) and warning (yellow)

### Release Notes

Release notes should be placed in `_posts/releases/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SHORTTITLE.md` and adhere to this format:

```
---
layout: post
title: Bitcoin version 0.3.24 released
src: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27771039
category: releases
---

Bitcoin v0.3.24 is now available for download at
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/>

...
```
* `SHORTTITLE` is used to construct the URL. Something like `v0.3.24` will be fine
* `layout: post` important for Jekyll
* `title: ...` will be used as the title
* `src: ...` (optional) link to full annoucement
* `category: ...` category of post
** `releases`
** `events`
