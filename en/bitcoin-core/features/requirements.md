# Bitcoin Core Requirements And Warnings
{:.not-displayed}

{% include bitcoin-core/download-bitcoin-core.html %}

Bitcoin Core gives you increased [security][bcc validation] and
[privacy][bcc privacy] at a cost. You need to [take
responsibility](#wallet-responsibility-checklist) for the security of
your bitcoins, meet higher [minimum system
requirements](#system-requirements), and beware of some [possible
problems](#possible-problems).

![Warning icon](/img/icons/icon_warning.svg)
**No matter what Bitcoin software you use,** you should never
buy more bitcoins than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is still an
experimental system and bitcoins remain a risky investment.

## Wallet Responsibility Checklist

Bitcoin Core puts you in charge of your wallet, which means your
bitcoins are at risk unless you complete certain tasks:

## Possible Problems

{% include bitcoin-core/bitcoin-core-possible-problems.md %}

<div class="not-displayed">
  <div id="backup_your_keys" title="Backup Your Keys" markdown="block">
  By default, you need to backup Bitcoin Core after every 100
  transactions.  This includes both transactions you send as well as
  payments you request (whether or not you actually received the payment).

  For example, you need to backup after sending 33 payments and requesting
  67 payments (even though you only received 60 payments).

  Bitcoin Core can be configured to allow you to go more transactions
  between backups.  See the [`-keypool` setting][bcc configuration].
  </div>

  <div id="secure_your_wallet" title="Secure Your Wallet" markdown="block">
  Anyone who gets access to your wallet can steal your bitcoins.  The
  first line of defense against this is encrypting your wallet, an option
  from the File menu in the graphical interface.

  However, encrypting may not be enough if your computer becomes infected
  by malware.  Learn about <button class="popup js" data-container="offline_wallet">offline wallets</button>
  for security against this type of attack.

  In addition to securing your wallet, you also need to keep your backups
  secure.  Anyone who gets access to them can also steal your bitcoins.

  </div>

  <div id="offline_wallet" title="Offline Wallet" markdown="block">
  Computers that connect to the Internet are frequently hacked or infected
  with bitcoin-stealing malware.  Computers that never connect to the
  Internet are a much more secure location for your bitcoins.

  Bitcoin Core can be run on an always-offline computer, creating an
  offline wallet (also called a cold wallet).  The offline wallet will
  securely store the private keys, while a separate online Bitcoin Core
  wallet will send and receive transactions.

  </div>

  <div id="bitcoin_inheritance" title="Bitcoin Inheritance" markdown="block">
  Your Bitcoin wallet isn't like a bank account---it won't automatically
  go to your heirs if you die or become disabled.

  You have to plan ahead and make sure there is a way for your heirs
  to access your wallet backups when you're no longer available.
