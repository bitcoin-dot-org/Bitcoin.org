# About the Bitcoin Core pages on Bitcoin.org

Bitcoin.org hosts several pages about Bitcoin Core as well as the
[Bitcoin Core downloads][bcc download], but the Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin
Core open source projects are run by separate teams.

## History

Bitcoin.org was originally used by [Satoshi Nakamoto][] to host his
[Bitcoin paper][bitcoinpdf]. Soon after, it began linking to
downloadable versions of the original Bitcoin software, making it the
homepage for the Bitcoin program.

New educational content about Bitcoin was added to Bitcoin.org over
time, but that home page remained even when the name of the original
program was changed to Bitcoin Core.

In the years since, the amount of content on Bitcoin.org has continued
to increase.  There's more content about Bitcoin Core than ever before
and also more content about other Bitcoin software and resources.

## Separation of concerns

As of Dec 2015, Bitcoin.org has 876 pages in 25 different languages,
but fewer than 100 of those pages belong to Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin
Core project has no control over those non-Core pages or any polices
enacted on them.

Likewise, content provided through the Bitcoin Core pages is not
necessarily endorsed or supported by the Bitcoin.org contributors.

## Maintenance

Pull requests and issues directly relating to Bitcoin Core are tagged as
*[Core][core github tag]* in the Bitcoin.org repository.
