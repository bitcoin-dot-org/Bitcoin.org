<h1>Bitcoin for Developers</h1>
<p class="summary">Bitcoin can be used to build amazing things or just answer common needs.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_simple.svg" alt="Simple" />The simplest of all payment systems</h2>
<p>Unless payment needs to be associated with automatic invoices, accepting money is as simple as adding a Bitcoin address to a website as a bitcoin: link or QR code. This very simple setup is within reach of any user and can fulfill the needs of a good range of clients. It's especially suitable for donations.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_conf.svg" alt="APIs" />Many third party APIs</h2>
<p>There are many third party payment processing services that provide APIs; you don't need to store bitcoins on your server and handle the security that this implies. At the same time, most of these APIs allow you to exchange your bitcoins into your local currency at competitive costs.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_own.svg" alt="Own" />You can be your own financial system</h2>
<p>If you don't use any third party APIs, you can integrate a Bitcoin server directly in your applications, allowing you to become your own bank and payment processor. With all the responsibilities that this implies, you can build amazing systems that process Bitcoin transactions with almost no fees.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_invoice.svg" alt="Invoice" />Bitcoin addresses to track invoices</h2>
<p>Bitcoin can create as many Bitcoin addresses as you want. So if you were to build a payment system associated with an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Bitcoin address for each payment. You can also use the same addresses once the payment is done.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lock.svg" alt="Security" />Most of the security is on client side</h2>
<p>Most parts of the security are handled by the protocol on the client and Bitcoin network side. Authenticity is verified through private keys, and double-spends are prevented through the Bitcoin network. That means no PCI compliance nor fraud detection. We love things that just work, don't we?</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_fast.svg" alt="Instant" />Instant transactions and confirmations</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is usually received within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transactions, it is recommended that you ask for a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_micro.svg" alt="Micro" />Cheap micro payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoin offers the lowest payment processing fees for any type of transaction, including micro-payments. This means that it can also be used to design and implement new creative online services that could not exist before only because of financial limitations.</p>
