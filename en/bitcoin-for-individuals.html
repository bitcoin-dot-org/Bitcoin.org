<h1>Bitcoin for Individuals</h1>
<p class="summary">Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_mobile.svg" alt="Mobile"/>Mobile payments made easy</h2>
<p>Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. And all you need to do to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_international.svg" alt="International" />Fast international payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, level outrageous fees, or freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_simple.svg" alt="Anytime" />Works everywhere, anytime</h2>
<p>Just like with email, you don't need to force your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lock.svg" alt="Secure" />Secure transactions</h2>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can make a payment on your behalf or charge you money without having a copy of your wallet. So as long as you take the required steps to <a href="/{{page.lang}}/{{site.section.secure-your-wallet[page.lang]}}">protect your wallet</a>, Bitcoin provides a nice level of protection against many types of fraud.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lowfee.svg" alt="Free" />Almost free to use</h2>
<p>Bitcoin allows you to send and receive payments for free. Except for special cases like very tiny micro-payments, there is no enforced fee. You can, however, choose to pay a small voluntary fee to increase your transaction priority and to remunerate the people who operate the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_anon.svg" alt="Anonymous" />Pseudo-anonymous online payments</h2>
<p>Anonymous payments are a part of our everyday lives - most real life purchases are done without the requirement to provide proper identification. Bitcoin now introduces the same freedom to the online world. It allows you to buy services or make donations without the hassle of being passed under x-ray. However, you should note that <a href="/{{page.lang}}/{{site.section.you-need-to-know[page.lang]}}"><b>full anonymity requires special efforts</b></a>.</p>
