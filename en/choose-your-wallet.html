<h1>Choose your wallet</h1>
<p>Your Bitcoin wallet is what allows you to transact with the world. It gives you ownership of Bitcoin <i>addresses</i> that you can use to receive coins from other users, and then lets you send those coins onwards. Just like email, you can receive Bitcoins when you are offline and all wallets are compatible with each other. Before you start with Bitcoin, <b>be sure to read <a href="/en/you-need-to-know">what you need to know</a></b> first.</p>
<h2>Get started fast and easy</h2>
<p>If you are new to Bitcoin, those wallets are a good place to begin.</p>
