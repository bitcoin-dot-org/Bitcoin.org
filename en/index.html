<h1>An open source P2P digital currency</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Bitcoin is a digital currency, a protocol, and a software that enables
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Instant peer to peer transactions</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Worldwide payments</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">Low or zero processing fees</li>
  <li style="padding:4px 0px;">And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin uses peer to peer technology to operate with no central authority; managing transactions and issuing Bitcoins are carried out <b>collectively by the network</b>. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment systems.</p>
