<h1>Support Bitcoin</h1>
<p>Bitcoin is a protocol that was born from a small community and has grown fast since. There are a lot of things you can do to help Bitcoin to spread and improve over time.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_multi.svg" alt="Bitcoin" />Using Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Obviously, using Bitcoin is the first thing you can do to help its development. There are probably many cases where it can make your life easier. And you can accept payment in Bitcoin yourself.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_network.svg" alt="Network" />Be the network</h2>
<p>You can join the Bitcoin network by keeping the <a href="/{{page.lang}}/{{site.section.download[page.lang]}}">original software</a> running on your computer. You can also do some Bitcoin mining to make the network more secure by helping to process transactions.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_conf.svg" alt="Development" />Development</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is open-source. So if you are a developer, you can use your super-powers to do good and <a href="/{{page.lang}}/{{site.section.development[page.lang]}}">improve Bitcoin</a>. Or you can build amazing new services or software that can use Bitcoin.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_donate.svg" alt="Donation" />Donation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to help is to <a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/donate">donate</a> a few bitcoins or to join the Bitcoin Foundation. The Foundation funds the salary for the maintainers of the core Bitcoin software, organizes conferences, and provides other important resources.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_spread.svg" alt="Spread" />Spread</h2>
<p>Speak about Bitcoin to interested people. Write about it on your blog. Tell your favorite shops you would like to pay with Bitcoin. Or be creative and make yourself a nice Bitcoin T-shirt.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_wiki.svg" alt="Wiki" />Wiki</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.bitcoin.it/">Bitcoin wiki</a> is full of useful and detailed information and we are constantly improving the information it contains - just like Wikipedia. You can help keep the wiki accurate and up-to-date.</a>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_translate.svg" alt="Translate" />Translate</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has already been translated into many languages. However, you can <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/">translate</a> it into new languages as well as improving existing translations. Translations in the <a href="http://en.bitcoin.it/">Bitcoin wiki</a> would be very welcome!</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_help.svg" alt="Help" />Help</h2>
<p>You can join Bitcoin <a href="/{{page.lang}}/{{site.section.community[page.lang]}}">communities</a> to give help to new users. You can talk about Bitcoin with other people, and you can learn more about it every day.</p>
