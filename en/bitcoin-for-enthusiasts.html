<h1>Bitcoin for Enthusiasts</h1>
<p class="summary">Bitcoin is changing the world of finance, by giving you control over your money.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_democracy.svg" alt="Democracy" />Bitcoin is a worldwide consensus</h2>
<p>Because of its decentralized, open-source nature, Bitcoin is the first payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority. Even Bitcoin developers have no power to force updates in the protocol if enough users, developers, or miners disagree. <i>You</i> have exclusive control over your wallet.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_network.svg" alt="Network" />Digital money made for the Internet</h2>
<p>Bitcoin was born from the Internet, bringing the freedom of physical money to the virtual world while making payments easier and more secure in both worlds. Bitcoin can offer an alternative to previous cumbersome and costly systems, and it can increase online business access to developing countries.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_own.svg" alt="Individual" />Protecting individual rights and freedom</h2>
<p>Bitcoin allows people to securely store and exchange value on a network that cannot be seized, manipulated, or stopped by any organization or individual. It gives many powerful tools to the people so that it is easier to protect individual rights against various levels of corruption.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_international.svg" alt="Global" />The first neutral global currency</h2>
<p>Not often in our history has money been disconnected from any political influence or national economy. Could Bitcoin be the first global currency to cross all barriers between nations, politics, and cultures for the benefit of the common good? It certainly looks like it might happen. One for all and all for one!</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_transparency.svg" alt="Transparency" />Promoting transparency</h2>
<p>All Bitcoin transactions are public, but the owners or recipients of these transactions are not. Organizations can choose to reveal their ownership of some Bitcoin addresses to their members, allowing them to implement high levels of transparency.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lock.svg" alt="Secure" />Making money more secure</h2>
<p>Thanks to a clever use of strict cryptographic rules, Bitcoin provides an amazing list of security features. Not only are bitcoins impossible to counterfeit or spoof, but the protocol is also built to be very resistant against an impressive list of attacks, including distributed denial of service.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_solve.svg" alt="Solve" />Solving issues with trust in banks</h2>
<p>Bitcoin offers solutions to many of the trust problems that plague banks thanks to selective accounting transparency, signature proofs, and irreversible transactions. It also increases the risks for crooked bankers: no bitcoins can be created to save them from their own mistakes at the expense of the people.</p>
