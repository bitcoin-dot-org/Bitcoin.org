<h2>Facts and FAQ</h2>

<div class="press-faq">
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What is Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is an Internet protocol and open-source software platform that enables a new completely digital and decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC).</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does one acquire bitcoins?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li>Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.</li>
    <li>Buy bitcoins at one of the Bitcoin Exchanges.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins using one of several services.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins face to face using a local directory.</li>
    <li>Earn bitcoins through competitive mining.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does Bitcoin work?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is a triple entry bookkeeping system where a public record of every bitcoin transaction is validated and distributed in real-time through the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network which is secured and regulated through cryptography.</p>
  <p>Anyone can process transactions using computer processing power, often with specialized hardware, and potentially earn a reward in bitcoins for this service which is often called 'bitcoin mining'.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Unrestrained payments</em> - Send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time.  No bank holidays.  No borders.  No imposed limits.</li>
    <li><em>Low or zero fees</em> - Bitcoin payments currently process at an optional 0.005 BTC transaction fee.  The fee is to prevent small transactions from unnecessarily flooding the network.</li>
    <li><em>No chargebacks</em> - Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible thus saving merchants from losses caused by fraudulent chargebacks.</li>
    <li><em>No identity theft</em> - Send and receive payments without needing your personal information tied to the transaction.</li>
    <li><em>Transparent money supply</em> - All information concerning the bitcoin money supply is readily available on the blockchain for anybody to see, verify, measure, and use in real-time.  There is no need for an “audit the Bitcoin” campaign.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Not widely accepted</em> - Most people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Everyday more businesses accept bitcoins, but the list is still small.  It will take time for Bitcoin to catch on and gain improved usefulness through networking effects. </li> 
    <li><em>Volatile</em> - The total value of bitcoins in circulation is still very small, therefore relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price.  Volatility is bad for a currency, but unfortunately there is no way around it.  Volatility will persist as the market scrambles to determine a bitcoin’s value as this nascent currency matures.  Never before has the world seen a startup currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li>
    <li><em>For geeks</em> - Bitcoin is still not ready for everyone.  The user tools are still in developmental stages, and non-technical types are likely to find Bitcoin difficult to set up in a proper, secure manner.   New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin easier, more convenient, more secure, and thus more accessible to the masses.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin secure?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The Bitcoin technology - the cryptography - is provably safe.  Bitcoin’s vulnerability is in user error.  Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost, or stolen if handled unwisely.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin legal?</a>
  <span>
  <p>To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has neither been defined legally in any jurisdiction nor made illegal.</p>
  <p>Additionally, regulators from various jurisdictions have taken steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to behave with this new technology. For example, the United States' FinCEN has issued non-binding and non-determinative guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>
  <p>Useful resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf">Virtual Currency Schemes - European Central Bank</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2013-G001.pdf">Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies</a></li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Are Bitcoin tax free?</a>
  <span>
  <p>No, and it’s a bad idea to try to evade taxes by using it.</p>
  <p>Firstly, tax authorities are quite good at finding people whose lifestyle does not appear to match their reported income, and detection of such disparities is independent of how the money is earned.</p>
  <p>Secondly, many kinds of taxes, like land taxes, do not require governments to engage in financial surveillance and thus the payment system used is irrelevant.</p>
  <p>Finally, there are research proposals for income/sales tax systems that can apply to Bitcoin and similar cryptographic currencies. Whilst they require implementation by governments, cryptographic tax systems can be highly efficient, secure and preserve the privacy of the system’s users, whilst still allowing the tax authority to learn how much tax is owed (but nothing else).</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Does Bitcoin enable or encourage illicit activity?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is really just a math problem. Individuals can use math, or any other tools, to engage in a wide range of behavior. But the underlying math or tools cannot encourage any behavior.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. However, it is not 'anonymous' but psuedo-anonymous. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records.</p>

<p>Bitcoin prevents many criminals from being able to engage in illegal behavior. Because Bitcoin is psuedo-anonymous customers do not need to reveal personal information to merchants. This decreases the amount of data available to illegal actors and acts as significant protection against identity theft, credit card fraud, counterfeiting, chargeback frauds and several other attack vectors.</p>

<p>Additionally, law enforcement authorities have already begun using sophisticated techniques to analyze bitcoin transactions in their criminal investigations. So it may be that the Bitcoin software is not very attractive for criminal enterprises.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</a>
  <span>
  <p>BA fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble.  An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble.</p>
  <p>The problem is that Bitcoin’s value is exceedingly difficult to determine.  Bitcoin is still in early stages of development, and faces countless unknowns going forward.  The value of Bitcoin is directly proportional to the number of people who value Bitcoin for it’s merits as a payment alternative, but there is no telling now how many people that may be.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How to explain the surge in Bitcoin’s price?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The price of bitcoins is determined by supply and demand. The supply is fixed at 21 million because of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. There are two main types of demand: speculative and transactional. As more people use bitcoins to transact economic activities this increases demand and the price of bitconis. So likewise as more people speculate on the future of bitcoin by saving or hoarding bitcoins then this increasees demand for bitcoins and the price. As more people own, use and accept bitcoin the result is an increase of network effects and increased adoption.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?</a>
  <span>
  <p>In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders gain exclusive profits at the expense of the late adopters while providing nothing in return. And as a general rule, the founders also persuade investors that they'll profit.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin has no central authority, and thus no one to make such promise. Bitcoin is just individuals working together all over the world to build a great, open-source payment alternative. Which have a concrete value as a competitive service to exchange and store value.</p>
  <p>A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. Early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has an intended win-win outcome: early adopters profit from the rise in value, while late adopters, and society as a whole,  benefit from the usefulness of a robust and mature global currency that could only develop if early adopters were wiling to take more risk than others. In fact, Bitcoin can be compared to a high-risk investment.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Why did Bitcoin’s price crash in June 2011?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price crash in June 2011. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, the largest exchange, MtGox, having a security incident, a large different between value and price from the large amount of press coverage which stimulated speculative demand which was not based on fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy and just old fashioned irrational exuberence and greed.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his real identity and simply left his invention to the world. After Satoshi created the first Bitcoin implementation, he remained active in the development for a short period of time before he chose to leave the project. Meanwhile, a strong community of developers, miners and users emerged to take over this great project.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is virtual and immaterial?</a>
  <span><p>Bitcoin is a completely virtual currency. Bitcoin is particularly well suited for use on the Internet unlike other fiat currencies and payment systems like credit cards. Additionally, Bitcoins and bitcoin transactions are not subject to counter-party risk like with traditional banks and this protects users from Cyprus-style problems and empowers Bitcoin users to have exclusive control of their funds.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Where does the trust in Bitcoin comes from?</a>
  <span><p>The entire currency is controlled by mathematics and cryptography, those being laws of the universe nobody can change. In fact, cryptography is far from new. Trust in online banking already depends on cryptography which is used to protect transactions and authenticity. Bitcoin only goes further and creates a complete payment networks that relies on these well known security mecanisms. The real innovation in Bitcoin is that it solves the problem of building a secure consensus on the network with cryptography in such a way that a central authority is no longer necessary.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is an anonymous currency?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. However, it is not 'anonymous' but psuedo-anonymous. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records. These records which include every transaction, IP addresses, etc. can easily be accessed by competitors, law enforcement or anyone else.</p>
  <p>However, there are rare and costly methods that enable users to use Bitcoin in very private ways but are, as the European Central Bank highlighted in the report on Bitcoin, largely limited to smaller transactions of less than $15 in value. Transactions larger than that get exponentially more difficult to conceal from best practices in network data analysis, data mining and forensic accounting techniques.</p>
