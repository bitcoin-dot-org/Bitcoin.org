<p>(TODO We can work on a good quality FAQ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQmXM_K0Vt7MiQ_ExrbSSzutSeXC8YOkkaCAzLfjR78/edit">here</a>.)</p>
<p>(Mike suggestion of describing future applications and benefits of the technology could also go there. In fact, we should not be afraid to have an extensive FAQ as long as it's relevant, I can create paragraphs that extend/hide at need, or create structured sub-categories.)</p>

<p>Some examples : </p>

<p><b>What is Bitcoin?</b></p>
<p>Bitcoin is a protocol and software platform that enables a new digital, decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC) that is secured and regulated through cryptography.</p>

<p><b>How does one acquire bitcoins?</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.  (Is there a well-maintained list of merchants accepting bitcoins?)</li>
<li>Buy bitcoins at one of the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins">Bitcoin Exchanges</a>.  </li>
<li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins using one of several <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_(the_noob_version)">services</a>.</li>
<li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins face to face using a local <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Directories">directory</a>.</li>
<li>Earn bitcoins through <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>How does Bitcoin work?</b></p>
<p>Bitcoin is basically a ledger, a public record of every bitcoin transaction, and it is distributed and maintained in real-time on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>“Miners” are computers on the Bitcoin network that dedicate their computing power to verifying and re-verifying every bitcoin transaction as they happen and storing this transaction history in what is called the “blockchain.”  By constantly auditing the Bitcoin network, miners secure against any fraudulent transactions, and for their efforts are rewarded newly minted bitcoins and by collecting transactions fees.  Miners are rewarded according to their relative processing power following a predetermined rate so that the number of bitcoins created never quite reaches 21 million.</p>

<p>(TODO We need to verify each file licence first)</p>
<p>(TODO We need to host those files somewhere else and link them there. Can we perhaps get something simple that is DDOS-proof for free?)</p>
