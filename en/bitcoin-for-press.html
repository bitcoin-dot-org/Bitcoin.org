<h2>Facts and FAQ</h2>

<div class="press-faq">
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What is Bitcoin?</a>
  <span><p>Bitcoin is a protocol and software platform that enables a new digital, decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC) that is secured and regulated through cryptography.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</a>
  <span><p>BA fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble.  An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble.</p><p>The problem is that Bitcoin’s value is exceedingly difficult to determine.  Bitcoin is still in early stages of development, and faces countless unknowns going forward.  The value of Bitcoin is directly proportional to the number of people who value Bitcoin for it’s merits as a payment alternative, but there is no telling now how many people that may be.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How to explain the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value?</a>
  <span><p>More people everyday are discovering Bitcoin and coming to understand it’s advantages.  They have begun using it and building up trust in it.  With the supply forever limited to 21 million, greater demand leads to higher price.</p><p>Consequently the higher prices have also attracted additional attention from speculators, which in turn further elevates the price.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin legal?  What about taxes?</a>
  <span><p>Yes, it’s legal.  Bitcoin users pay taxes on their bitcoin transactions just as they do on their economic activity denominated in dollars, euros, or any other currency.</p><p>Useful resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf">Virtual Currency Schemes - European Central Bank</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2013-G001.pdf">Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies</a></li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?</a>
  <span><p>In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they’ll profit.  Bitcoin has no central authority, nor does it make any such promise.  Bitcoin is just individuals working together to build a great, open-source payment alternative.</p><p>A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game.  Early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has an intended win-win outcome: early adopters profit from the rise in value, while late adopters, and society as a whole,  benefit from the usefulness of a robust, efficient, trustworthy, global currency.</p><p>The fact that early adopters could benefit more than late adopters does not make Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme.  Any potentially successful investment has this quality.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is virtual and immaterial?</a>
  <span><p>A bitcoin is a balance only you can spend, just like money in credit cards and online banking systems. As of today, most transactions are done through the banking and credit card networks. Thus, Bitcoin is no more virtual than what people are already using everyday. And Bitcoin can also be used to pay in physical store using mobile applications. However, as opposed to traditionnal banks, bitcoins are not under the exclusive control of a single organization. Bitcoin users have an exclusive control on their funds.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Where does the trust in Bitcoin comes from?</a>
  <span><p>The entire currency is controlled by mathematics and cryptography, those being laws of the universe nobody can change. In fact, cryptography is far from new. Trust in online banking already depends on cryptography which is used to protect transactions and authenticity. Bitcoin only goes further and creates a complete payment networks that relies on these well known security mecanisms. The real innovation in Bitcoin is that it solves the problem of building a secure consensus on the network with cryptography in such a way that a central authority is no longer necessary.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does Bitcoin work?</a>
  <span><p>Bitcoin is basically a ledger, a public record of every bitcoin transaction, and it is distributed and maintained in real-time on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network.</p></span>

<h1>TODO</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The FAQ needs to be completed</li>
  <li>The volunteer interviewees list need to be extended. Perhaps this can be pretty useful : <a href="http://btcxperts.com/">BTCXpert</a></li>
  <li>We need to have appropriate licence for each material</li>
  <li>We need hosting for media files</li>
  <li>A list of good quotes needs to be done</li>
  <li>And well, any more comment is appreciated</li>
</ul>
