<h2>Facts and FAQ</h2>

<div class="press-faq">
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What is Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is a protocol and software platform that enables a new digital, decentralized currency called bitcoins (BTC).</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does one acquire bitcoins?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li>Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.</li>
    <li>Buy bitcoins at one of the Bitcoin Exchanges.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins using one of several services.</li>
    <li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins face to face using a local directory.</li>
    <li>Earn bitcoins through competitive mining.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How does Bitcoin work?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin is basically a ledger, a public record of every bitcoin transaction, and it is distributed and maintained in real-time on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. The whole network is secured and regulated through cryptography.</p>
  <p>Anyone can help the network to process transactions using the processing power of specialized hardware and be reward by the network for their services.  This is what is often called “mining.”</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Unrestrained payments</em> - Send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time.  No bank holidays.  No borders.  No imposed limits.</li>
    <li><em>Low or zero fees</em> - Bitcoin payments currently process at an optional 0.005 BTC transaction fee.  The fee is to prevent small transactions from unnecessarily flooding the network.</li>
    <li><em>No chargebacks</em> - Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible thus saving merchants from losses caused by fraudulent chargebacks.</li>
    <li><em>No identity theft</em> - Send and receive payments without needing your personal information tied to the transaction.</li>
    <li><em>Transparent money supply</em> - All information concerning the bitcoin money supply is readily available on the blockchain for anybody to see, verify, measure, and use in real-time.  There is no need for an “audit the Bitcoin” campaign.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Not widely accepted</em> - Most people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Everyday more businesses accept bitcoins, but the list is still small.  It will take time for Bitcoin to catch on and gain improved usefulness through networking effects. </li> 
    <li><em>Volatile</em> - The total value of bitcoins in circulation is still very small, therefore relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price.  Volatility is bad for a currency, but unfortunately there is no way around it.  Volatility will persist as the market scrambles to determine a bitcoin’s value as this nascent currency matures.  Never before has the world seen a startup currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li>
    <li><em>For geeks</em> - Bitcoin is still not ready for everyone.  The user tools are still in developmental stages, and non-technical types are likely to find Bitcoin difficult to set up in a proper, secure manner.   New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin easier, more convenient, more secure, and thus more accessible to the masses.</li>
  </ul>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin secure?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The Bitcoin technology - the cryptography - is provably safe.  Bitcoin’s vulnerability is in user error.  Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost, or stolen if handled unwisely.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin legal?</a>
  <span>
  <p>So far, recent guidance from the US Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) acknowledges Bitcoin as a “virtual currency” and is a positive first step toward regulatory acceptance in the US.  Bitcoin’s legal status is young and will vary by jurisdictions over time.</p>

  </ul>

</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Are Bitcoin tax free?</a>
  <span>
  <p>No, and it’s a bad idea to try to evade taxes by using it.</p>
  <p>Firstly, tax authorities are quite good at finding people whose lifestyle does not appear to match their reported income, and detection of such disparities is independent of how the money is earned.</p>
  <p>Secondly, many kinds of taxes, like land taxes, do not require governments to engage in financial surveillance and thus the payment system used is irrelevant.</p>
  <p>Finally, there are research proposals for income/sales tax systems that can apply to Bitcoin and similar cryptographic currencies. Whilst they require implementation by governments, cryptographic tax systems can be highly efficient, secure and preserve the privacy of the system’s users, whilst still allowing the tax authority to learn how much tax is owed (but nothing else).</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Does Bitcoin enable or encourage illicit activity?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin have both advantages and drawbacks when it comes to illicit activities. Despite being censorship resistant, Bitcoin is generally less anonymous than cash, because each transaction leaves a permanent and public trace that can be used in criminal investigations. Anonymous transactions are possible, but full anonymity always remains very fragile.</p>
  <p>Given that authorities will probably receive more training in the future, Bitcoin ability to increase or decrease criminality is still to be confirmed. However, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will ever replace government printed cash as the prefered currency for black markets.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin might also decrease criminality in some specialized areas. Because the way it works prevents nothing less than chargeback frauds, credit card identity theft and money counterfeiting.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</a>
  <span>
  <p>BA fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble.  An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble.</p>
  <p>The problem is that Bitcoin’s value is exceedingly difficult to determine.  Bitcoin is still in early stages of development, and faces countless unknowns going forward.  The value of Bitcoin is directly proportional to the number of people who value Bitcoin for it’s merits as a payment alternative, but there is no telling now how many people that may be.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">How to explain the surge in Bitcoin’s value?</a>
  <span>
  <p>More people everyday are discovering Bitcoin and coming to understand it’s advantages.  They have begun using it and building up trust in it.  With the supply forever limited to 21 million, greater demand leads to higher price.</p><p>Consequently the higher prices have also attracted additional attention from speculators, which in turn further elevates the price.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?</a>
  <span>
  <p>In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders gain exclusive profits at the expense of the late adopters while providing nothing in return. And as a general rule, the founders also persuade investors that they'll profit.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin has no central authority, and thus no one to make such promise. Bitcoin is just individuals working together all over the world to build a great, open-source payment alternative. Which have a concrete value as a competitive service to exchange and store value.</p>
  <p>A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. Early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has an intended win-win outcome: early adopters profit from the rise in value, while late adopters, and society as a whole,  benefit from the usefulness of a robust and mature global currency that could only develop if early adopters were wiling to take more risk than others. In fact, Bitcoin can be compared to a high-risk investment.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Why did Bitcoin’s price crash in June 2011?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The precise reason for the downturn is hard to speculate, but some cyber attacks on the largest Bitcoin exchange, MtGox, are often reported as the origin of a loss of confidence combined with the end of the May/June press cycle that reduced Bitcoin’s exposure to the public. This part of Bitcoin history also has a strong correlation with usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycles</a> that occur with new innovative technologies. This <a href="http://www.bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#czsg2011-05-01zeg2011-12-07ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv">chart</a> illustrates the price history over that period.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin?</a>
  <span>
  <p>The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his real identity and simply left his invention to the world. After Satoshi created the first Bitcoin implementation, he remained active in the development for a short period of time before he chose to leave the project. Meanwhile, a strong community of developers, miners and users emerged to take over this great project.</p>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is virtual and immaterial?</a>
  <span><p>A bitcoin is a balance only you can spend, just like money in credit cards and online banking systems. As of today, most transactions are done through the banking and credit card networks. Thus, Bitcoin is no more virtual than what people are already using everyday. And Bitcoin can also be used to pay in physical store using mobile applications. However, as opposed to traditionnal banks, bitcoins are not under the exclusive control of a single organization. Bitcoin users have an exclusive control on their funds.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Where does the trust in Bitcoin comes from?</a>
  <span><p>The entire currency is controlled by mathematics and cryptography, those being laws of the universe nobody can change. In fact, cryptography is far from new. Trust in online banking already depends on cryptography which is used to protect transactions and authenticity. Bitcoin only goes further and creates a complete payment networks that relies on these well known security mecanisms. The real innovation in Bitcoin is that it solves the problem of building a secure consensus on the network with cryptography in such a way that a central authority is no longer necessary.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="#" onclick="faqshow(event);">Bitcoin is an anonymous currency?</a>
  <span>
  <p>Bitcoin can either be the worst currency to protect privacy, or an anonymous currency. That only depends on how it is used. Every transaction leaves a permanent and public trace on the network. Also, IP addresses can be easily loggued by anyone. And except for anonymous donations, you always have to reveal personal information during a transaction in order to receive what you pay for. Thus, keeping full anonymity with Bitcoin is possible, but clearly not as easy as it seems.</p>
