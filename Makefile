## all links which previously pointed to the second-occuring header now
## point to the first-occuring header. (Example: before this test was
## written, links pointing to the ping RPC were silently redirected when
## the P2P ping message was added to the page.) The pattern below will
## report a false positive if we legitimately have an id ending in '-1',
## but that should be easy to work around if it ever happens.
