Bitcoin.org is proud to announce the addition of a dozen new pages to
the site about [Bitcoin Core][].  Several of the pages describe [Bitcoin
Core's powerful features][], others [provide help][] for Bitcoin Core
users, and several make it easier to [start contributing][] to
Bitcoin Core.

Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin.org have come a long way since the site
began promoting the earliest public versions of the software.

These new pages give us a chance to introduce more recent Bitcoin users
to the advantages of full nodes like Bitcoin Core, particularly how full
validation [helps protect Bitcoin's essential decentralization][] from
takeover by a handful of miners, Bitcoin banks, and service providers.

## A Brief Guide to The New Pages

- [Bitcoin Core overview][]: provides a brief description of Bitcoin
  Core and links to the other sections of the sub-site.

- [Feature overview][]: briefly describes some of Bitcoin Core's
  leading benefits and links to pages that provide more details.

- [Get help page][]: resources to help Bitcoin Core users find help.
  Prior to this PR, we also created and filled a category on the Bitcoin
  Wiki with all the existing [Bitcoin Core help pages][].

- [Contribute overview][]: links to ways you can directly contribute to
  Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Core users.

## Future Plans

We plan to enhance this new section of the Bitcoin.org website by
collecting together some of Bitcoin Core's disparate documentation and
providing instructions for important ways users can enhance their privacy and
security while using Bitcoin Coreâ€”such as using Tor and an offline
wallet.

In addition, we hope to provide more resources that help businesses
understand the benefits of validating the transactions they receive with
their own full nodes.

If you want to help, please feel free to email the Bitcoin.org
documentation maintainer,
{{site.text.bitcoin_org_docs_maintainer_email_link}}.
