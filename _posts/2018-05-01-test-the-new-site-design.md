## A Redesigned Bitcoin.org

One of our goals in 2018 has been to modernize the look and feel of
Bitcoin.org. Each day, tens of thousands of new users come to Bitcoin.org to
learn how to get started using the currency and technology. The site has grown
exponentially in popularity as Bitcoin adoption has increased. Last year alone,
there were over 30 million visitors to Bitcoin.org. These visitors viewed the
site's pages over 200 million times. Many of these pages are often the first
results on search engines for bitcoin-related phrases and terms.

As traffic and engagement has increased, however, the design has become very
dated. In fact, the current look and feel of the site has pretty much remained
the same for ~5 years, going all the way back to 2013. As a result, a large
amount of effort and attention has gone into a recent redesign project, that's
getting closer to complete. After holding a [community vote](https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/vote-on-the-new-site-design)
on various design options, the community selection has been extended into all of
the different subpages.

We've reached one of the most critical phases of the project, now, which is
getting feedback and lots of help testing from a bunch of different people,
before it goes live.

If you visited the link above and experienced any issues or have feedback, please
[send us an email](mailto:will@bitcoin.org?subject=Redesign%20Feedback") or
[open an issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/new?title=Redesign%20Feedback)
on Bitcoin.org's GitHub repository. Please also make sure to note your device,
operating system and browser version(s), when applicable, to give us additional
context and clarity - it is super-helpful.

Even the most minor bits of feedback, nits or issues are welcome. The community
we are all part of is very diverse, and we want to strive to make Bitcoin.org
the best site it can be for as many people as possible.

## Acknowledgments

Bitcoin.org is funded exclusively by donations from the community, and a huge
debt of gratitude is owed. Without community donations, the current redesign
work would not have been possible. More enhancements and special projects are
on the horizon, so stay tuned. The support from donations that allow
Bitcoin.org to compete with sites that aren't community supported, are greatly
appreciated.

A big thanks is also due specifically to Natalia, Marek and Oleksandr at
[ETHworks](https://ethworks.io) who have spear-headed the redesign efforts,
worked tirelessly, and have delivered great results from the very beginning,
every step of the way. They are amazingly talented people in the cryptocurrency
space.

## About Bitcoin.org

Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.

There have been over 3,200 commits from 180 contributors from all over the
world. In addition to this, over 950 translators have helped to make the site
display natively to visitors by default in their own languages â€”now 25
different languages and growing.
