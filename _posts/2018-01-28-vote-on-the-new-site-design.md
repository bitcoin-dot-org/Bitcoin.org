![Redesigning Bitcoin.org](/img/blog/free/redesigning-homepage.png?{{site.time | date: '%s'}})

As one of the most-visited websites in the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin.org helps
millions of people each month, learn more about Bitcoin. One of our goals in
2018 is to modernize the design of the site in an effort to continue to
provide rich content and information to users in an efficient way, as Bitcoin
technology continues to evolve.

Below are three new homepage designs we'd like to vote on. Each version
shows what the homepage would look like on a desktop, handheld or tablet
device. The version that receives the most votes will then be further extended
into the subpages of the site:

+ Version 1 ([Desktop](https://invis.io/W6F8UUDPX#/272286353_1-8-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver1_Desktop_1200px) / [Handheld](https://invis.io/BJF8UVJYA#/272475274_1-8-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver1__Mobile_320px) / [Tablet](https://invis.io/MSF8UUNYZ#/272470844_1-8-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver1_Tablet_768px))
+ Version 2 ([Desktop](https://invis.io/VGFB69IYR#/273185825_12-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver2_Desktop_1200px__1) / [Handheld](https://invis.io/TJFC8U3WVK3#/273522832_12-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver2__Mobile_320px) / [Tablet](https://invis.io/PXFC8P6MK9W#/273522833_12-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver2_Tablet_768px))
+ Version 3 ([Desktop](https://invis.io/6VFF8CB9CJA#/274446152_19-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver3_Desktop_1200px) / [Handheld](https://invis.io/SVFG91LJAZ9#/274784637_22-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver3__Mobile_320px) / [Tablet](https://invis.io/C6FG9114QGM#/274784638_22-01-18_Bitcoin-org_Ver3_Tablet_768px))

## About Bitcoin.org

Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.

There have been over 3,200 commits from 180 contributors from all over the
world. In addition to this, over 950 translators have helped to make the site
display natively to visitors by default in their own languages â€”now 25
different languages and growing.
