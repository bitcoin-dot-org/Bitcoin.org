[Bitcoin Conference](http://bitcoin2012.com/), London Sept 15-16. [Ticket price](https://sites.google.com/a/bitcoin2012.com/homepage/tickets) is €70 (Bitcoin accepted). We have a prestigious venue in central London with max capacity for 700 people.

We want something for all parts of the community by having very in depth talks from experts about Bitcoin in: development, economics, law, finance, social, ethics.

Our [first conference](http://bitgroups.org/) was about planning the future. This conference will be bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream. We will reach out to the general public with primer talks and workshops. We hope for this conference to bring greater opportunities to the community by promoting upcoming talent, and bringing investment to this fledgling economy.

Confirmed speakers include [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman), [Max Keiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_keiser), [Birgitta Jónsdóttir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birgitta_J%C3%B3nsd%C3%B3ttir) and others.
