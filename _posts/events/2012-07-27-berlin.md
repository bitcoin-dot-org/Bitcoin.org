[Berlin Bitcoin Hackathon](http://bitcoin-hackathon.com/), 13-15 July: hackers will gather in Berlin geekdom for a weekend of intense coding an collaboration. There will be more than 200 BTC in prizes, and a dinner at the Bitcoin bar; room77. Participants are coming in from Switzerland, Austria and Finland. The event is free.

Important: this event is for the general public, and not only programmers. We actively welcome people with diverse skills like media or activism. There are many [interesting non-programmer](http://bitcoin-hackathon.com/index.php/Main_Page#Ideas) projects like a guerilla marketing campaign.
