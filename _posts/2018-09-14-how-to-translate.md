If you're a fluent or native speaker of a language other than English, this
blog post will help you learn how to get started translating Bitcoin.org so
that more people around the world who speak your language can learn about
Bitcoin.

*Thank you to Simon AKA “Komodorpudel” for preparing content to help organize this post.*

## Getting Started with the Translation Team

Translations for Bitcoin.org are done on a website called [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/). Basic instructions for how Transifex works can be [found here](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started/translators).

**Below is a summary:**

1. [Create a free Transifex account](https://www.transifex.com/signup/).
Creating a Transifex account is free and not much information is needed.

2. [Join the Bitcoin.org translation team](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/)
and select the language you want to translate the site into. Your request to
join a team will be accepted instantly, and you will be a translator for the
language you selected. If your language is not available yet, close the pop-up,
scroll down, and navigate to “Request language”.

3. Play around with the interface. Transifex's interface can be a bit confusing
and it cannot hurt to take a look around. As a translator, you cannot cause any
harm as you can only edit unreviewed strings. A complete history is saved for
every string, making it impossible to destroy previous work. In the beginning,
stay away from the Glossary as this can be edited by new translators but no
history is saved.

4. [Join the Telegram group for translators](https://t.me/bitcoinaroundtheworld).
The website maintainer, both team leaders for translations, a number of language
coordinators, and various translators are present in this group. We are happy to
help in case you need assistance.

5. Choose what you want to translate. Navigate to the "Dashboard" on the top of
the page, then to "Languages" and select your language. You will see a lot
of different resources and their progress. Each resource consists of a number of
strings. A string is a "string" of text on Bitcoin.org. Each string has three
possible states - "untranslated", "translated but unreviewed", and "reviewed".
Only the first state "untranslated" is relevant for most translators. However,
if you find a "translated but unreviewed" string that contains obvious mistakes,
you are free to correct them. "Reviewed" strings can only be changed or
unreviewed by reviewers. The first resource "bitcoin.org" contains all strings
of the main page. Start here. Everything else that follows starts with
"devdocs...", indicating that these files are part of the developer
documentation. It is recommended that you only try to translate the developer
documentation if you are an experienced Bitcoin user and/or developer with a
profound understanding.

6. Start translating. You must be a native or fluent speaker for the language
you choose to translate. Please be careful to preserve the original meaning of
each text. Sentences and popular expressions should sound native in your
language. Translations need to be reviewed by a reviewer or coordinator before
publication. Once reviewed, coordinators will notify the team leaders that a
certain translation is ready for publication. If in doubt, please contact the
coordinator(s) for your language on Transifex.

7. Please take a look at the Responsibilities and Tasks section below to learn
more about the different types of users that you'll encounter on Transifex
when helping translate Bitcoin.org.

## About Bitcoin.org

Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.

Despite being a privately owned site, its code is
[open-source](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/) and there have
been over 3,200 commits from 180 contributors from all over the world. In
addition to this, over 950 translators have helped to make the site display
natively to visitors by default in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.
