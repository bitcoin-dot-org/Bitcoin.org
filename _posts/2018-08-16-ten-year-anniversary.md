## Bitcoin.org, registered August 18, 2008

{:.center}
![Bitcoin.org is 10 Years Old](/img/blog/free/bitcoin-dot-org-10-years.gif?{{site.time | date: '%s'}})

This month marks 10 years since the bitcoin.org domain was registered.
Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Bitcoin's first two
developers, Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi. When Satoshi left the project,
he gave ownership of the domain to additional people, separate from the Bitcoin
developers, to spread responsibility and prevent any one person or group from
easily gaining control over the Bitcoin project.

Bitcoin.org's code is open source. Final publication authority is held by the
co-owners, but all regular activity is organized through the public pull request
process and managed by the site maintainer. To date on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/), there have been over
4,400 commits from 245 contributors from all over the world. In addition to
this, over [1000 translators](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/)
have helped to make the site display natively to visitors by default in their
own languages â€” now 27 different languages and growing.
