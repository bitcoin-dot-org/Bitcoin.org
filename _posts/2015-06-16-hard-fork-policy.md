This policy applies to full node software, such as Bitcoin Core,
software forks of Bitcoin Core, and alternative full node implementations.

It also applies to wallets and services that have the ability to detect
hard forks, and which release code or make announcements indicating that
they will cease operating on the side of the majority consensus.

>>Wallet authors and service providers who would like to discuss their opinions
>>or contributions relating to hard forks should open an issue or submit
>>a pull request specific to their requested change.

Core developers and contributors will review these on a case-by-case basis.
